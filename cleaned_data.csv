I left off doing a review hoping it would get better, however after playing for something over ten hours and constantly being dismayed with new bugs each time, I can't. See, I do recommend the game for what it could, or hopefully will, be. It has nice enough graphics, a fun story that wraps itself around the inn management content and great art. I love these management style games, and this is easily addictive and with good management tools that suits the theme of the game well. To me it has the signs of creators who wanted to make the best game, and had passion for their creation.   It's just a pity that the good feels crumbles too quickly. I can't at times tell what are meant to be a challenge by the game or simply a broken chain created by a bug somewhere. And that is where ""get it"" has turned into ""wait until the bugs are out"". I have only played the campaign as I wanted to see the main story as well as leaning how to best play it, but I've not really achieved either. There was always one issue or the other that popped up, making me give up the game and let it rest for a time before picking it up again only to face a different issue. Previously I gave up over my workers never cleaning, turns out the trick (from a user in the forums) was changing their work priorities and closing the inn so all they did was clean to stay on top of it. The new issue now is that my mugs are stuck in the dish washer. Forums didn't have a solution for how to fix it and I could not afford buying new mugs for single use... so I am on another wait.  Of course, I could be very unlucky and others' experiences might not be as unfortunate as mine. I do suggest you read through more reviews before you decide fully. Though if bugs and such issues are enough to turn you off a game, then I heartily recommend you wait. I will return to this game, maybe in a month or so, hoping the worst of the issues are gone and that I can finally enjoy the story with the challenges the developers had in mind and not those created due to bug issues. When that happens this review will certainly reflect that, too, because when this game does work I have plenty of fun.

125511286,8500,EVE Online,76561198021699684,0,2,25,0,25,1668497481,english,"I've played EVE for a total of 3000+ hours in my day (granted not on steam, sorry Valve) I played hundreds of hours of Dust514 on PS3, I played EVE Valkyre, and even Eve Gunjack. But specifically for EVE online, A few highlights: I was in an Alliance Tournament at one point (X I think, back when Ishtar's were the meta). I spent significant time in Null sec, did a large chunk of time in J space, did some black ops drops back when that was hot, spent a few months at EVE uni (shout out to the uni), made a freighter alt for Red frog to do some logistics and make some side hustle money, Made my own corp for a bit and tried to get that up and running. More time in null sec doing smaller alliance nonsense. So I'm..well versed in this universe.   EVE, can be fun. But good lord does it make you work for it. This game is filled, from Fountain to Cobalt Edge, with highschool kids and edge lords. It's the biggest, largest collection of of teenage clicks and in-groups all sitting at the tables, throwing food at one another. You'll absolutely have to go out of your way to try and overlook the blatant immaturity, racism, homophobia, transphobia, you name it. I'm too old to put up with that shit for the sake of a space game.  Want to go make some money? They call it ""jew'ing"". I kid you not. And try to bring up that fact? Well prepare to get kicked out of their group for not fitting in. Want to fly a ship you like the looks of better than what the current meta is? Tough shit, go find another corporation to join. Want to train something else because you want to fly a big capital ship? Tough shit train this meta first (meaning spend weeks of real in-game time, training skills/ships, or buying the skills with IRL money).  Okay, so maybe you'll just go solo? Set out on your own and try and hunt down your own fortune? Well, do you have an army of bots? No? Well then good luck getting those juicy asteroids. Sure there's plenty of belts in High-sec, or maybe you're daring and want to risk low security space. Well even then, you're mining asteroids for hours before you even approach the cost of the ship you're in. Because the fastest ships in the game are used to pin you down and keep you from escaping with valuable loot, and the kids I mentioned above love nothing more than roaming around griefing anyone they don't like. Including if not most of all, anyone trying to make money from PvE activities.   The individual mechanics are fun, it can be cool flying around in giant space submarines. The graphics are neat, the audio is good, think of it more as a space sim, rather than an MMO and you'll be off to a good start. But the playerbase is fucking awful. It's League of Legends bad, if that tells you anything. CCP absolutely knows, and looks the other way for a lot of their abuses (they even forced a few employees to quit).   Maybe none of that bothers, by all means go and enjoy yourself. Personally, I wish I had quit long before I actually did.  Dev response response:  Thanks for responding, I agree it largely depends on the type of people you're playing with. The problem, is the vast majority of the EVE community is awful to be around. This is a community fostered by CCPs lack of action. For example, take the EVE university wiki page on allowed scams in the game: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scams_in_EVE_Online  For anyone curious, just google it, look at what people in EVE's forums say, make the call for yourself if this is the type of community you're willing to put up with, it's your life. As I said originally, I just found it wasn't worth it in the end to put up with that only to be camped in a station for hours waiting on standby, or to simply go out and run static WH connections to make some money to buy ships, that I didn't even want to fly because that was the meta.",1668498220,1686799181,0,145,13,0.802437901496887,0,0,0,0,1,

It was especially fun around the time when this game was finally released on Steam and many new players started playing.  This brings me to the point of this entire review: the fanbase. The fanbase is an absolute act of atrocity. The playerbase that still remains are, for the most part, absolute sweatbags. They've developed a highly elitist and toxic behaviour that doesn't promote new players to actually keep playing the game. I've seen this happen on numerous servers I've played in the close past.  For example, I joined the biggest server available and not only was I being actively made fun of by 12 ""veteran"" players simultaneously for not following their specific steps, but the server admin also decided to take it upon himself to keep ragdolling me and killing me in the end.  The good within the community simply fled, game isn't interesting enough to keep playing forever by yourself and those who stay eventually become douchebags.  tl;dr Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game expecting Charborg/Criken levels of fun if you don't have your own group of friends to play with.

50534129,349790,Galaxy of Pen & Paper,76561198054259090,0,10,921,0,921,1557266679,english,"As a fan of both the original Knights of Pen and Paper and Chroma Squad, it really pains me to give this game a thumb down. There is a lot of elements to this game I do enjoy; the pixel art and retro 3D are delightful to look at and filled with a lot of detail and creativity, the space ship battles are simple but addictive, and the larger emphasis on creating your own missions and influencing the direction of the main story beats through character and GM decisions is a good one. And when a story mission is good, it is VERY GOOD, using its limited systems to explore neat ideas, characters, or concepts.   However, there is a ton of stuff that holds this game back. The leveling and combat system is a huge step back from previous Pen and Paper games. For the majority of your characters, there are only a small handful of level ups that are actually interesting, and those are the ones where you unlock a new slot for an ability. Everything else is just all around stat boosts. This is a problem because early game, you only have two characters, limiting the amount of creative tactics you can do for some time. Even when you do get a full party though, it still takes until the mid to late game for you to unlock enough slots where you can actually afford using abilities that require a team effort. The actual combat system itself is also limited, with a character location system that is greatly under used. There were only a few battles that actually made me need to think and strategize, with the rest either being painfully easy or simple slogs to get through.   The pacing of the game is also very flawed due to how the mission structure works. There is very little reason or incentive to go off of the main campaign and explore the galaxy, as there's not much to do other than scan for resources (which get you very little money and underwhelming rewards from the few people that actually want them), fight enemies yourself just to grind, and maybe find a weaponsmith to upgrade gear. There is no way to track the few side quests you can find in the world, which you can only found by checking every single map node with a dialogue option and hope you don't run into a random NPC who tells a joke and nothing else. This means if you do find a side quest, you better remember both the exact thing they wanted, the node they're on, the planet they are from and how to find that planet.   Likewise, world exploration is so boring. You may run into a random encounter sometimes, but they are usually all positive and give minor rewards. I only got into a random battle once, and that was from my own dialogue choice.   This is because the game wants you to make your own side missions, which reward money, experience, and reputation points (which can give you universal rewards as you gain them) and let you decide between a wide variety of activities, locations, and quest givers. The problem here is that the actual amount of points you get for doing these missions varies randomly, and it is far too easy to just create missions that give you the most reputation points the fastest and being done with it. There is very little reason to get creative and explore all the options available to you.  The best part of the game by is the variety of character class missions, which have you going on mini-adventures to unlock new classes to play as that all connect to a larger narrative. It was when the game felt its best, giving you a compelling mystery to follow, choices to make, and interesting characters to meet. The problem here is that you will already be close to filling out your party limit by the time you get to these missions, so if you want to make use of these classes, you need to bench one of your characters and make a new player. For some people, that may not be an issue, but for a game where you are playing as kids trying to play a table top RPG, there is something very strange about kicking out one of your players when their character is already connected to the larger story at play in favor of a random new character who's class may not even be very good. It feels at odds with the tone and mood the game wants to set.   I feel like calling this game ""first edition"" is good. It feels like a very rough proof of concept, and I honestly believe that with enough time this game could be remade as something truly great, truly matching the promise of creating your own adventure through a set of friends playing a game together. As it stands though, I would steer clear of this game for now, and buy one of their other products. Chroma Squad or one of the earlier, more mechanically fleshed out Knights of Pen and Paper games.  EDIT: And only now do I realize that this game is actually a couple years old now. Something tells me there may not be a second edition coming out anytime soon.",1557269958,1557272108,0,156,4,0.915461301803589,0,1,0,0,0,
