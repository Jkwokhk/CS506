I expected this game to be a regular farming game where you repeat the same task of plant, harvest, sell, upgrade, repeat, with some NPCs that can give you some daily missions to help you progress faster. But this game had me completely immersed every time I booted it up. This game isn't only about farming and efficiency, but it's about living the life of a resident who just moved into a new town to find a more fulfilling life. You're categorized as a farmer, but you also have side hobbies and a social life as any other human being would. As a farmer, you plant a variety of seeds, and care for your farm animals. You can then sell the produce to help the community thrive. According to the grandma the grumpy old geezer likes tulips, maybe you could give him the left over tulip you kept in your chest. Though if you're tired of farming, you could go collect sea shells for fun and sell them for a quick buck so you could buy that slick sword you were eyeing at earlier, or you could enjoy fishing for salmon at a riverbank using that sick new fishing rod you just bought. Though working can be tiring, maybe going to the town festival can help you relax, that purple haired girl seems nice, maybe you could go befriend her by giving her a purple geode you got earlier from mining. What I'm trying to get at is this game is a masterpiece that can pull you into it's immersive gameplay. I wouldn't say this game is for everyone, maybe you're into the satisfying feeling of mercilessly killing demons, or maybe you're a masochist that finds it fun for all your progress be demolished by a minor mistake. But if you want a game that can help you be at ease and immerse you into playing for hours, then this is a game I can 100% recommend to you.",1686409417,1686409417,1,160,3,0.91562819480896,0,0,0,0,1,

They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you",1683216700,1683216700,1,426,30,0.859113216400146,9,1,0,0,1,

I'm generally afraid of games with grinding potential, but questlines starting from daily errand from bulletin boards and ending on Ginger Island offer some ending points, arbeit 100% perfection is quite a long task to not skip with using some external help. I didn't mod, but thinking back going for SMAPI at least for not switching to wiki as often and animation cancelling shortcut would make progression so much more manageable.  It's great how this game manages having potential both for casual and for min-maxing, and personally for me I would love to play it casually, but I can't chill untill chests are sorted.

It is one of the most stressful farm-life simulators I've ever had the pleasure of buying more than three times across multiple devices and platforms. Sure, the game starts out innocently enough: your dear grandpa bequeaths you a farm, inviting you to escape ""the burden of modern life"" where you're tasked with rehabilitating its dilapidated acreage by transforming it from an OSHA-inspector's wet dream into a fully operational profit-churning machine whose yearly revenue can rival the GDP of a small nation. A small ask.  Little does the game prepare you though for the various monkey wrenches it throws your way while you stand there like an idiot, pick in hand, not knowing the first thing about farm life because—let's face it—you're a soulless city-slicker whose ""bright spirit"" was already destined to ""fade before a growing emptiness"" (gee thanks grandpa for keeping it real I guess). Little obstacles, like: tools not being good enough to clear that damn stump/boulder; having to build relationships with country bumpkins whose realities are so different and in some cases so f***ed up you have no idea how to even begin to relate with them just so you can get access to various recipes as well as the one mirror in all of Stardew Valley that'll let you change your clothes and hairstyle; and constantly being reminded of the relentless march of time ever tick-tocking towards the end of a productive workday filled with tilling, planting, watering, running 20 miles back and forth between farm and town, mining, fishing, [i]fighting literal monsters[/i], and—just as importantly—socializing with the town's poor, unfortunate souls who are just as stuck here as you are but lack any agency in escaping the fates of their own making. Oh but god forbid you try staying up past 2am just to fit everything in this busy schedule, no, [i]that's[/i] not healthy for you!  Eventually you learn the tricks of the trade to earn you your first thousand, then hundred thousand, then million gold. You navigate the mazes of interpersonal relationships and escape the labyrinth wedded to a partner willing enough to spend the rest of their tiresome life with you. You figure out what exactly it is that this town needs to restore the magic that your grandpa once saw in it, and after driving out the oppressive force of capitalist greed that plagued the inhabitants of Stardew Valley for years... [b]you optimize the shit out of your farm to maximize profits.[/b]  So no, Stardew Valley is [i]not[/i] a feel-good, lackadaisy wonderland full of flowers and rainbows that you can jump into after a loaded day to [i]destress[/i]. I mean sure, you [i]could[/i] play it more relaxed than how I describe, by actually taking your time to soak in the game's beautiful art and catchy music, fully appreciating the work of a single developer whose entire focus and passion were poured into making such a beloved videogame worthy of adoration in the same breath as classic Legend of Zelda and Super Mario titles. You [i]could[/i] do that... but the Community Center won't rebuild itself, and Penny's birthday is just around the corner.  This is why I can't stop buying it every time it's re-released on a new platform. 10/10 would farm again.",1675015012,1675015225,1,376,131,0.911817848682404,0,0,0,0,1,

Anyway here's a lemon pie recipe:  Graham Cracker Crust: 1 1/2 cups  graham cracker crumbs 1/4 cup  granulated white sugar 6 tbsp melted butter  Lemon Filling: 2 x 14-oz cans  sweetened condensed milk 1 cup fresh lemon juice 6 egg yolks 2 tbsp finely grated lemon zest  Method: -Preheat oven to 350°F / 180°C -Mix the crust. Add the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter into a mixing bowl and stir until well combined. -Transfer the crumb mixture into a 9-in / 23 cm deep-dish pie pan. Press the crumbs tightly into the bottom and up the sides of the pie dish. Set aside. -Mix filling. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a large mixing bowl and add the egg yolks and lemon zest. Whisk to combine. Add the lemon juice and whisk vigorously until well combined and you no longer see any juice. The lemon juice will thicken the condensed milk. -Bake. Pour the lemon filling into the prepared pie crust. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. The lemon pie is done when the edges are set and only slightly jiggly in the centre. -Cool & refrigerate. Remove the pie from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. Once cool, cover the pan and refrigerate until firm for at least 3 hours before serving. -Garnish. Decorate the pie as desired. I dressed up my pie with puffs of whipped cream, lemon slices, a sprinkle of lemon zest, and sliced almonds. -Serve. Slice the pie into 10 to 12 pieces and serve cold.

They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

The event that occurred next nobody could have predicted. An event of great magnitude and catastrophic cost. I have dedicated the past month to achieving all 40 achievements this game throws at you. It starts out easy. Oh yeah get 50,000 gold. Oh nice, cook 25 recipes. However what they don't tell you is the majority of the achievements are only gained at the end. And I don't use the word end lightly. It took me 3 in game years to achieve this feat. Yes it can be done in two, but at this point, 2 years? 3 years? 10 years? it all feels the same. The monotonous tasks of filling casks with fruit to make wine. Grinding for the mythic prismatic shards. It takes so long. And none of these tasks are boring, or un-fun. The entire time I was thrilled. But I lost a part of myself somewhere along the journey. Something that I will never get back. Maybe it was when I accidentally spent all my qi gems on 250 qi seasoning, or maybe it was the time I mis-clicked a mega bomb after finishing designing a part of my farm. Wherever, whenever I lost that part of myself doesn't matter. Its gone for good. All we can do now is look to the future. Keep our heads up and keep on marching. Maybe one day I may wake up and it will all feel like a bad dream. And only then will I be able to rejoin society as a normal person once more.

It took me so long to play this game, so many people recommended it and I kept putting it off and off. Mostly because of graphics among other things. I played all Harvest Moon/SOS games and those type of games in recent years were getting really stale with the same tired formula. But eventually I got Stardew Valley on Switch so I could play it on the go like a DS- and my god- I wish I'd of picked it up back then!  I've sunk hours and hours into this game but one of the best pluses is that I connected with my friends/family playing it co-op. I love the gameplay, it's suited to any playstyle- you wanna just play a dating sim, it's that, farm sim? Go raise some livestock or grow crops and trees. Just like designing stuff? You've got numerous Farm layouts to choose from and go ham. Maybe you like combat- or just plodding about adventuring. There's always something new in this game and was addicted well and truly. And I am in the minority that absolutely love the fishing game!  Then, I bought it on steam and was introduced the modded community and fell in love with the game again. It opens up the game completely and there are so many mods that turn the game into something completely new. Or if you're like me and loved the core game, just adding stuff into it that's just for aesthetics or adds new places/people. Similar to how you would add DLC to a game. My favourites and 100% must haves are ""Stardew Valley Expanded"" ""Ridgeside Village"" Hell there's even magic now so you can be your own wizard!!    What I will say is that SMAPI- the modding device is pretty complicated to put in, but the mods themselves are really simple once you get past initial setup!   I do appreciate that I played it vanilla first and I would recommend anyone do that FIRST because like a good book/movie you can't experience twice, this you actually can and it's worth it.

I've eagerly awaited a port for PC but as of yet it currently can only be played on PC using an emulator.  Stardew Valley gave off some very similar vibes though so I thought maybe it might be close enough to sort of fill that same gap.  The game starts out simple enough, your grandfather left you a farm and you need to work to repair it and get it up and running again.  You chop logs, break rocks, till soil, plant seeds and harvest your crops.  There's a  lot of room to play around with your farm and where you want to place things.  There's also a foraging aspect which helps encourage exploration of your surroundings too.  The game is more than just a farming sim though, it also has RPG elements and you can battle monsters in the mines that in turn drop loot you can use or sell.  In addition to that it has some adventure game aspects such quests and some fairly light puzzles.  You can date and marry certain people in the town and even have two kids.  Later in the game you can even forge your own weapons and equipment and add specific power-ups to them.  I grew up on pixel graphics so I found the graphics to be somewhat nostalgic feeling.  The animations are fairly simple and the character sprites very 2D but the characters themselves, not so much.  Each character has a bit of a backstory and unique character traits you get to know as you build friendship points.  At certain levels of friendship you're given the treat of special little cut scenes.  You get to make choices on how you respond to the cut-scenes too.  Sometimes it can help your relationship or hurt it.  This adds quite a bit of story elements to the game.  Part of the beauty of this game is that you can play it in so many ways.  If you just want to have a calm farming experience, growing crops, playing around with aesthetics or optimal functionality in your builds, then you can play it that way.  The music in the game somehow manages a great balance of calming and upbeat.  If you want a little more excitement you can delve deep in the different mines and battle a variety of monsters and collecting and crafting better gear.  If you like adventure then you'll probably want to work on completing quests and solving the puzzles.  If you're more into stories you'll probably enjoy making friends with everyone and exploring their personalities.  Really, there's a little something for everyone and enough content that if you get bored there's something else to try.  In the early game it really feels like completing the community tasks mounts to a climax.  It's easy little goals to attain and strive for but once you finish the community center that's really just the beginning of the game.  You can unlock other mines, a desert, and an Island.  The game is much more expansive than you will first anticipate and it's possible that the developer may release future expansions to bring even more content and explorable areas.  The game does have a sort of ""ending"" in which you'll see a special cut scene but you can keep playing on so the game doesn't ever truly end.  You can also create a new character to play again from the beginning.  There are different farm types that present different challenges and benefits which make for a little replay-ability.  In addition to different maps you can also play this game in co-op mode with friends.  I don't personally like multi-player experiences, I prefer solo adventures, but I do like that if you chose to play this way each character can have their own house and while you can work together, you can also go off and do your own thing.  You aren't limited to the host's farm or experiences and guests can upgrade their cabin, get married, and essentially experience everything the games has to offer.  There are really only two things I disliked about this game.  First, there's the save function, you can only save by going to sleep (or ending the day by falling asleep outside your home/bed or ""dying"" in the mines {you can't actually die you just get beat to within inches of your life apparently}).  Sleeping ends the day and your game progress is saved.  However, I often find that I have to leave my game in the middle of a day when I don't have time or the ability to finish my day or even run to my bed so I can save.  Instead, I had to open the menu, which pauses the game, and then either just leave it running in the foreground or if I had to do something on my computer, let it run in the background till I could get back to the game.  So, for example, at the time of writing this review, Steam has 1,062.9 hours logged playing this game.  However, between my two save files I only have about 509 hours logged in-game.  So, it spent about half the time sitting open in the background on my computer simply because I could hit a save button and continue later.  The second thing I didn't like was the fishing mini-game.  I've played plenty of games that have fishing mini-games in them and they are all similar but all have their own unique flair... this one is the worst fishing mini-game I've ever played.  Maybe other people found it easy but I couldn't get how to catch fish.  There's something to do with patterns and clicking at the right times but I completely failed at it every time.  The only thing that made fishing redeemable was actually a mod that let me skip the mini-game portion.  While I don't necessarily advocate mods, I found the game partially unplayable because of this mini-game and it was really ruining my personal experience with playing the game.  The mod made the game playable and fun again.  Mods are actually one of the things that for some players could be a real plus side to the game.  Stardew Valley has a fairly large modding community with mods for everything from changing the NPC's dialogue avatar to skipping fishing mini-games to adding elevators to creating new expanded areas to explore.  If you find yourself too frustrated with an aspect of the game, there's probably a mod for it.  If you love mods for games you'll love this game.  The last thing I'd like to touch on is the game's achievements.  There's 40 of them which is a fair amount and most will unlock naturally over time with normal gameplay, but there are several collection based achievements that you have to work for.  Many of those require a lot of hours of game play.  For example, if you want to catch all the fish you won't be able to do it unless you fish in every season, some require reaching maximum friendships which can take a lot of time to build, and of course others require you to get a huge sum of money.  Collectible items are gained through RNG drops so even if you do everything right you could be doing it a long time to get those drops you need.  For completionists, like me, that can be very frustrating and it's a big part of why I had to put in about 500 hours to get all the achievements.  It could be a lot less or even more depending on your luck with the RNG.  Overall, this game is a gem, I don't usually recommend games at full retail price, but I'd say this one is actually worth it.",1652163400,1652163414,1,151,4,0.895357608795166,3,1,0,0,0,

Yes, the game is very relaxing and extremely fun, but there is no ""trying"" Stardew Valley. Should you buy this game, then you best believe that you're going to spend at least 40-100+ hours playing it the first time around. It's not a waste of time, not at all. Call it an investment of your time. When it comes to this game, ""like"" is synonymous to ""addicted"". So telling others that you ""like"" the game is the same thing as hiding your addiction (so just accept it for what it is). Stardew Valley is also synonymous to ""productiveness"". No, it's actually the very definition of productivity, since you're going to wish you were as productive in real life as you are in-game.  ~~ [u] It starts with making your own character, choosing the farm that you think looks the best or most fun and also picking your companion pet. I'm not going to spoil you on what ""Favorite Thing"" is about. [/u]  During the first few days of Stardew, I pretty much spent my time cleaning up the front yard of the farm. I just couldn't stand the sight of all that clutter and foliage on the ground and repeatedly getting stuck between twigs and rocks was surprisingly infuriating. Lewis, the Mayor of the town, had given me 15 parsnip seeds on my first day to help me with starting my farm. But ""cleaning"" took a lot more energy out of my character than I expected. I found it to be quite enjoyable breaking all of those rocks, cutting down the trees and mowing the grass, since it felt like I was actually cleaning for once.       It wasn't until later that I would regret not starting with the farm earlier, since that would have meant getting more income in the earlier stages of the game. That's the thing with these types of games though. You are always going to regret making some of your decisions, whether it's buying the wrong types of crops or planting too many crops and wasting all your energy watering those crops each and every morning. Or you can be like me and do both of those examples at once on top of planting your crops way too late into the season.  Anyways, I obviously got the materials for cleaning the farm, but it's not like I knew what to do with it. I ended up just making a few chests, changed their individual colors and then I began organizing everything that I had gathered. Which was basically just plant fiber, twigs, stones and then the occasional clay that I accidentally got from using the wrong tools on the wrong things. After that, I finally decided I would head into town to try and interact with as many people as possible in one day. I kept getting handwritten mail from characters I had yet to actually meet each and every morning, so naturally I became more and more curious of the town and less interested in cleaning. It took me around 3-4 days before I began to explore, but my farm was basically clear of anything that I might get stuck on further down the line so I didn't really feel like I wasted any time.       I began my exploration quest with going into random buildings and interacting with every person I saw. Gus, the owner of ""The Stardrop Saloon"". Alex, his sweet grandmother, Evelyn and his very friendly Grandpa, George that I gave a Dandelion to because I was curious as to what would happen if I gave someone a gift. “This is probably the worst gift I've ever seen. Thanks a lot.”  No, thank you George for that lovely comment.  I also talked to Pierre, the owner of the general store and his wife (Caroline) and daughter (Abigail). This was also when I used the starting money to buy more crop seeds, tulips and parsnips because ""why not"" I remember thinking to myself... I then decided to head down south to look for this ""Willy"" guy that said he was waiting near the beach or something. On the way there I noticed a trash can that I for some reason decided to try and interact with. I then learned something very interesting. Interacting with a trash can is the same as ""searching"" the trash can and that naturally grosses people out. This is how I met a girl by the name of Haley. She just kind of stood there staring at me while I was digging through the trash, and I was staring back at her. Since it worked so beautifully before, I decided to give her a gift as well because I didn't know if people would start to hate you for doing, well, what I did. I would like to say that I ""learned from my mistakes"", but that wasn't the case at all, I can't even say that as a joke. Yes, you probably guessed it right, I gave her a Dandelion, thinking that ""She can't possibly hate them as much as George does right?""  “Ugh...that's such a stupid gift.”  Thinking ""Haley must be related to George"", I reluctantly went down to the beach wondering if I should give Willy, the fisherman guy a Dandelion. As it turns out, I was to be the one on the receiving end. He gave me his rod and man, I never thought that such a simple fishing Minigame could be so fun. I stood there for the rest of the day, wasting away on my character's energy till I had no more. ""You feel sluggish from over-exertion."" It was the first time I was staying up past 12 in-game and my character was walking slower than ever before. I already knew beforehand that your character faints after 2 am, but the only way to make it back to bed in time would be to eat one of the fishes I had caught to regain my stamina. But I wasn't going to break, bend the knee to a fish and eat it raw like Gollum. I was going to sell them all no matter what. So yeah, I just fainted and sold them all the next day at the cost of some extra energy. Probably wasn't worth it, but I did get a few extra pennies that I wasted on buying more seeds. I should've saved up for a better fishing rod...  So anyways, good game.",1642964940,1643122799,1,178,34,0.908675253391266,0,1,0,0,0,

Not in real life.), very tiring battle, generating income, and plenty of grinding, I’ve finally beaten the game. And not gonna lie, I really liked the game. And this time, I’m gonna review this piece of gem.   First off... [h1][b]--==Story & Character==--[/b][/h1] Since this is actually contain spoiler, so... [b]SPOILER ALERT!!! Only click it if you’ve beaten the game or if you don’t care about the spoiler.[/b] So, for the story, I’m only gonna give you the sypnosis of the intro. I can’t give you the rest of the story. Because... I just don’t want to. So, Here we go. [spoiler]One day, Your grandpa was sending you a message that he wanna give you farm and tell you that you might feel bored about the modern life in the future. Which 15 years later (whatever), You really become bored and really tired because you have to work over, and over. And, when you checked your cabinet, there’s an envelope in there. And, it was your grandpa. He wants you to change. It was the same thing happened to him before, and he tell us to just throw what we have now aside, and move into the village called “Stardew Valley”. And with that, You decided to do it. You took a bus into the village. And while you finally there, someone welcomes you. Her name is Robin. She then takes you into your grandpa’s farm. Which is, yea. Looks filthy nowadays. And then, She shows you your new house to live in from now on. And then there’s a male elder (and yeah. I actually don’t wanna call it “Old man”. Kinda rude for me, man!) which his name is Lewis. He was the mayor of the Pelican Town, which is the town in Stardew Valley (Hmm... Why I call it village earlier, then? Heh. Whatever.) He welcomes you to the town as well. And then, He tells you how good, but also rustic your grandpa’s house is (Which is yours as well.). Though, I think it still looks great. And, since you’ve been gone into so much bus trip to the village, He asks you to get some rest, so you can explore it the next day. And, he also inform you that If you can sell your stuff into the shipping box. And, you finally take a rest, and your new life is begin.[/spoiler]  And that’s it for the story I can give you. The game actually has some backstory that is really good, and might suprises you. And, The game’s not only have the town’s story. You also have a story which involves the company that you just left. And then, The Character. There’s ton of them. Each of them has some personality. And, Each of them has some schedule and things to do, but sometimes they went into somewhere else. And also, each character have some background and events that’s actually great to look at, and can make you either love them even more than ever, Make you think twice for trusting them, or even fully hates them. Which is amazing.  And now, the second thing of the game’s aspect...  [h1][b]--==Graphics==--[/b][/h1] Not gonna lie. I actually don’t really pay much attention about the graphics. I actually can just put it into the end, or I can just throw it into the træshcan (ngl I actually don’t know who is Danny Devito. But I like this word.). But, This is review. So, I should talk about it. For the graphics, well. I like it. The dev uses the retro graphic, which is looks great to me (Not that I actually liked the retro graphics to begin with.). The backgrounds and locations were looks good, and in fact it’s good on any season. The character sprites are really great to look at. The monsters are amazing. And, the portrait on the other hand.... Umm... I actually used a mod called “Anime Portrait” by OhoDavi, because I love it so much, despite the fact that I never watched Anime. But to be honest, The Original Portrait looks good for me. I actually liked it.  And now, The most important aspect in the game for me, which is....  [h1][b]--==Gameplay==--[/b][/h1] Now, How do I say about this? Oh yeah. Have you ever played Harvest Moon? If you do, It’s almost similar like it. If you don’t, That’s okay. I’ll tell you. First off, the farming. Obviously! You have Regular Farm, The Cave, and Greenhouse. The regular Farm looks very messy at the first time, and you obviously need to clean it before you can use it. And then, If you have cleaned it, You can use it to plant anything, from Potato, Pumpkin, to even Trees (If you need more of it to make your Farm looks good). And, You can make your Plants grow faster, or better. And don’t forget to take care of them from any “Intruder”. And just like Harvest Moon, Some plants can only planted to a certain season. Which means, You can’t just rely on single plant to get rich. Second one, The Cave. You can use it to harvest some Fruit Bats, or Mushrooms, But You need to make money before you can use it, Because It’s empty for the first time. After that, don't forget to chech it daily. And Last one, The Greenhouse. Like I said before, you need to do some chores to unlock it. And After that, You can use it to Plant anything in there just like you do in the Regular Farm. When I said anything, I mean [b]LITERALLY ANYTHING[/b], Even if it's not on the right season. So, If you wanna plant your favourite plant, You can plant it there, as long as you have the corps, that is. The Second one is Mining. Just like Harvest Moon, you can Mine some ore and minerals. You can use them to upgrade your tools, or just donate them to The Museum. You need Pickaxe to mine, obviously, and then go into The Mines. In there, Not only there’s ore and Minerals to Mine and take, There are also enemies to stop you, Which will talk about it soon. And speaking of The Mine, There’s two of them. The regular and The Harder one. In the harder cave, Not only there are some high quality ores and minerals in there. But, There are powerful enemies in there as well. You need more powerful gear to get in there. And then, Combat. Oh boy, the combat. First off, There’s some enemies in the game, In the Mines especially. Some of them are flying, some of them aren’t. You fight them with Sword, Bombs, Or even Slingshot. And, The more levels in the mine you get, The harder The enemies are. Sometimes, They dropped some stuff that can be used to craft something that can help you to fight the enemies easier. And also, try not to let them get you game-ended. Anyway, This is amazing. I like it. Oh wait! You think That’s the only thing you do in the game? Haha! No! There’s other thing you can do, in this game, Like Talking to other people, Play some minigames, Fishing, Having relationship with people either into different gender, or same gender, Get Married, Go into the Event and Carnival, and many more.  And then the last aspect of the game is...  [h1][b]--==Audio & Soundtrack==--[/b][/h1] Yeah. The audio is really good. The ambience is amazing. It always make me got relaxed for listening into it. And the Soundtrack was pretty great, Especially The Winter one. I really liked it. The songs makes me got relaxed even more. I can’t explain it more. I just really liked it. You can just experience it yourself.   [h1][b]--==Conclusion==--[/b][/h1] So, In Conclusion, I really liked the game. It’s a great game. It makes you reminding of the old days playing Harvest Moon (For people who ever played Harvest Moon). You can either buy it on Sale, or Buy it immediately. Anyway, That’s it. Hope this review make you wanna buy the game.   [h1][b]--==Final Score==--[/b][/h1] [b]All Hail Stardew Valley / 100[/b] Thumbs up for this game! Hope This game released in the Afterlife as well.

My nomination for Steam labor of love award 2021.  Stardew Valley is not just a farming sim, it's a life sim; it's not just a video game, it's an experience, and one of the most immersive ones ever existed. Unlike some other Harvest Moon clones that either forces you to grind hard or have tedious progression, Stardew lets you relax, set your own goals, choose your preferred pace and tell your own story. There is so much to do in the game that can't be written in just words, and it just gets better the more hours you put in it.  Only a few games make you feel the love the developers put into them, Stardew is definitely one of them.

I started and stopped this game numerous times over the years and it just couldn't hook me. One word: Mods. This game has a lovely set of bones, a wonderful base. But mods really do make this game tailored specifically for your tastes. And the modding community is so imaginative and amazing. This is a super easy game to mod.   Get through the first year. It's tough, but you can do it. Focus on sprinklers early (which means grinding the mines). The faster you can get out of watering your crops everyday, the sooner you can enjoy other aspects of this game such as fishing, adventuring, socializing, and decorating. Your farm is a canvas, and you can truly paint a beautiful picture.   This game has a special place in my heart.

Considering that this masterpiece was created by only one person who did not have much experience creating games before, Stardew Valley is a must-buy and is an excellent quality game. The game is relatively chill and you can choose what pace you wish to play the game on. You do not have to worry about much and some people consider it their comfort game. Barone (Stardew Valley's creator) had added many things to the game that he had wished as a kid when he would play simulator games. The fantastic music, good retro-like graphics, amazing gameplay and story add up to make the beautiful game that is Stardew Valley. It has many game play paths that you can choose from. You can have a loving family with children while being a professional cook and being a spectacular farmer, fisherman and cave scavenger! As i must not lie, I wouldn't recommend this game to people who love action shooter games that is very active as Stardew Valley is a very laid-back game.  +Fun Facts+ In the earlier days of Stardew Valley, Barone would look on reddit and recover many people's corrupted save files! He also has no means of adding any violence to Stardew Valley (ie. Butchering, Poaching) and the closest thing to that is slaying monsters in the mines. Stardew Valley was inspired by Harvest Moon, a very similar farming simulator. Barone intended to add the things he thought was missing in Harvest Moon.  =Verdict= GIVE ME MORE CLAY  damn i really spend a load of time on this review",1628223671,1631991358,1,180,9,0.847453594207764,2,1,0,0,0,

It's gotten so bad that I have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game. I open the game and blink and two hours have passed, and while I feel sad that I just lost so much time, I look at the progress I made on my farm and think, ""Worth.""   This is one of the most fun games I've ever played.  It's designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive / optimization-oriented players to have a blast with this game. There is so much to do in this game, and there's so much to offer. You can spend your days farming, fishing, mining, foraging, talking to the villagers, etc. The game is made in a way in which you don't have to hyper-optimize every little detail like min-maxing profit, time management, etc, because there's no time limit for things (unless you count seasons, but there's always another year) and there's no stakes. But if you want to, you definitely can.   Talking to the villagers is fun as well, they're well-designed, and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules. There's a lot of details in this game.  I haven't tried the multiplayer, but from what I've seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends. But playing solo is extremely fun as well.  My only gripe with the game is that it's a huge time sink. I waited until my semester was over to get into it because I heard about the time sink beforehand, and I was glad I waited, because all I can think about now is, ""What crops am I going to plant next season? Where I should place them? How much money am I making from these? Should I fish or mine? Did I feed my animals today? DID I TALK TO ROBIN TODAY?""   And of course, Robin is best girl, no discussion there.",1621881010,1622004885,1,282,78,0.939376354217529,0,1,0,0,0,

Apart from the COVID pandemic, i was struggling with high anxiety/depression, college was online and the pressure, both from the university and myself, never stopped. It was hard. I cried a lot. But somehow i got through this. I never played this kind of game before, sort of ""Harvest Moon""-like i guess. But i wanted to try something that i could just... Relax. Enjoy. Take a deep breath and calm my mind. Relieve the tension. Chill.  Stardew Valley, for me, was kind of... a life saver. I'm still playing it (100h and counting) and the game still do what it did in the beginning: it's an incredibly charming and relaxing game, it's fun and it has likable characters, so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot. It's one of my favorite indie games ever now. Right beside Bastion, Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight, other favorites of mine.  Stardew Valley calmed me when i needed most. And i will not forget that.

Each season one can plant new crops and harvest them throughout every month (which counts as a season), whilst completing bundles at the local Community Centre in order to claim rewards and selling home-grown produce at shops or the sale bin from the comfort of your own farm.  One can construct cabins and farm buildings, plant and harvest multiple types of plants, and even plant your own orchards. Mining and foraging, along with crafting and fishing, are also important dynamics of the game and boost your experience level in the game, as well as assisting in the completion of quests.  One can buy animals as cute and practical additions to your farm. If you're keen on cooking, there is a conglomeration of recipes for you to try from fish tacos to chocolate cake. Your culinary skills will be honed!  If you are a naturally organised and productive person, there's plenty on offer to suit your game style, boasting daily quests, the opportunity to customise your personal routine, and much more.  Home-decor enthusiasts may also go crazy with the wallpaper, furniture and decorations if they so desire.  Of course the game also features a rich storyline, including the ability to interact with local villagers, make friends, and eventually, marry if you wish.  The freedom to make your own decisions every single day heightens my enjoyment of the game. One of my favourite features of the game are the flowers and scenery and - of course - the animals. My cat Mocha is my favourite and I am eagerly working towards purchasing a horse which will provide speedy transport. :) There really aren't many negatives to speak of, but if I were to name some, I would think that some of the big ones for me are the following:  1. How difficult it is to reach level 40 in the mines (and progress from thereon).  2. How difficult it is to catch fish.  3. How slowly a person walks.  I definitely recommend this game to farming enthusiasts and animal lovers alike, as well as anyone who enjoys setting goals and creating routines and just enjoying the game without a ""tycoonist attitude"" which is adjacent to a lot of gamers nowadays. I wouldn't recommend it to those of you out there who love 'reaching the end of the game as quickly as possible', with a cut-the-time-wasters attitude. It is a slow-moving, relaxed sort of game perfect for those who don't take gaming so seriously, but of course it caters for most gamers' tastes. :D",1615180363,1669625180,1,97,2,0.849437654018402,0,1,0,0,0,

Bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you're spending working in a big firm (feel free to imagine it as Amazon/Nestlè)... you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure.  2- [b]The core gameplay is based on farming, but you can ""drop"" it or leave it aside after a while, you're free to design your gameplay:[/b] Even though clearing debris, pruning weeds, killing evil monsters and  cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point, you're not ""forced"" to keep farming 24/7, as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun, such as: - tending to animals; - mining; - foraging; - fishing: - more...  3- [b] the customization has a external and a deeper side:[/b] this means that besides customizing your own home, buildings and clothes there is a skill system, which can shape and improve the way on how you've decided to play the game;  4- [b]Stardew Valley is a living community, its people are likable and your activities make a difference:[/b] The NPCs are actually interesting and they're worth your time, socializing with them, helping them and confronting them on events, quests is always a good distraction and worth your time, as they'll be quite rewarding in terms of money, items and story progression in general, even though you're not forced to follow any particular path. Your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city.  5- [b] there's a strong and thriving MOD community and the game allows multiplayer gameplay:[/b] I personally recommend Stardew Valley Expanded as a mod to be installed, feel free to check it on Nexusmods  6- [b] the 1.5 update is extremely good and needed [/b] my biggest gripe with SV [u]before[/u] this free massive update from December 2020 was that there wasn't enough end-gameplay elements or goals to be reached. This update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area, distant from Stardew Valley, by adding new minerals, animals, crops, quests, weekly quests, npcs and much more, including many quality of life changes, which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid.

This game lets you be what you want to be, and rewards continued gameplay with even more depth. Be a farmer and grow rows upon rows of crops, be a miner and go spelunkling, be a fisherman and go fish for so godawful many types of things you can fish up. You can even be a lumberjack if that so fancies you.   The people you meet, the quests you get into, the sheer amount of things to do, you will not put this game away for the first while. Once you're hooked, you're hooked deep.   The graphics only adds to the pleasantry of the game, bringing both a fun way to do shading and objects, but doing so in a retro manner so both young and old can play along. And the sounds are contributing equally as much to make the experience of playing this game so much more eventful and amusing.   It is warmly recommended and with as much effort as has been put into the game and with as many hours as you'll likely end up spending on this game, it's more than well worth the money spent purchasing the game.",1609071438,1609071438,1,136,3,0.884451329708099,0,0,0,0,0,

I have never played a farming sim before this, and honestly I thought I wouldn't like it because it was so different from the games I usually played at the time (FPS). As soon as I cracked it open, I felt the joy of 100 perfect headshots of a PvP match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain was melted by the gracious and time-taking beauty of Stardew Valley. The amazing 16-bit design of the character portraits, freshly tilled ground, and don't get me started on the fishing. Without any guides, I made 15,000 Gold before Winter, and even with watching guides, you never feel like you're cheating yourself, because there's just so much joy to it that it is impossible to ruin the game with watching videos about (spoiler) and (spoiler).

""How on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming?"" Well, it's a lot easier than you think.  Stardew Valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job, only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago. A promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them. Our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to Stardew Valley, an unknown paradise far away from the city. And it is here, where their life truly begins.  I can only wish that we all find our Stardew Valley someday. Yee-haw.",1605992560,1605992560,1,552,46,0.955722749233246,1,1,0,0,0,

Sometimes its just a good time or a fond memory. Other times its a life lesson. This game is the last one. Sometimes when I play games I have the habit of rushing through them and completing them in one or two sittings. This is a game where you simply can't do that. You must be patient. You must plan ahead. You must control your impulses and delay gratification. Sure you can sell your crops immediately, but if you chose to wait several days you will profit much more. Oh you want pomegranates? Well you need to wait a month for them to grow, and even several years for them to mature. This game is full of planning ahead like that, but in doing so it encourages you to make the most out of your day and enjoy the journey along the way.

I played a lot with my girlfriend at the time, and when we broke up, I stopped playing for a while and deleted the save. A few months later I was in a low place, so I bought this game on Switch and completed the story and got married, and had kids (so I sunk in a fair amount of hours ~200) It was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as I wanted to keep playing. As I recovered from that dark part of my life, I played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me. So now I've been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown. This game as a whole has helped me through a lot, and has given me a bunch of great memories.

The game gives you a big assortment of animals, crops and fruit trees, which you'll need to tend to and sell, or use them to create artisan goods. Eventually, you'll have access to tools that automate your daily watering, feeding, shearing, milking, and egg collecting, which enables more time to focus on the social aspects of the game, or fishing, or exploring the mines. Each character can be given up to two gifts per week, which increases your friendship level, granted they like the item you hand to them. As your friendship grows, you may be treated to a cutscene when you run into that character next. Friends will also give you useful gifts and recipes in the mail so try to remember what everyone likes and keep them on hand. The mine is a great resource for stone, geodes for the museum, and valuable minerals. It's full of monsters and you can easily get in over your head if you aren't careful or come unprepared. If you pass out in the mines, the valuables you just found are liable to be stolen, or you may be subject to a rescue fee. My advice is to not focus too heavily on farming or making money. Diversify your days and work towards completing the achievements in the menu. Also, don't neglect the community center; gather or plant everything you need for the current season. There's nothing worse than having to wait a whole year to complete the community center because you forgot to plant it before the season changed. And don't feel disheartened if grandpa gives you a bad review. Keep playing past the two year deadline and stop when you feel accomplished.

I joined my friends lobby with the sole purpose of doing absolutely no work and being a general nuisance. One day I woke up and got around to getting out of bed at the early hour of 11 AM. I decided to take a romantic stroll through the quaint town nearby. I discovered the town had an old fashioned saloon, being the alcoholic I am irl, I joyfully entered. Unbeknownst to me, money is shared between all players. I spent all of our shared earnings on a single beer. We were now broke.  Much later I learned how to build a relationship with the NPCs of the town. I had my eye set on one frequent saloon goer, all I had to do was gift her everyday? Easy. My entire inventory was filled with fish, an excellent gift for anyone! I gave her one of my most impressive catches of that evening, a gold-starred halibut. Her eyes met with mine and she told me ""What am I supposed to do with this?""   Heartbroken and devastated, I returned to the pier where I spent most of my time. That's when I met a boy who lived nearby there, Elliot. I gave Elliot a gift of fish. He greatly appreciated it. I returned there everyday to continue my days of fishing and sharing with my new love. Turns out I was gay all along. Most nights after a hard day of fishing, I spend most nights at the saloon with Elliot, spending all of my friends hard earned cash. Never did I think I could live my love life, be a drag down on someone else's hard work, and be drunken fisherman in a videogame. Stardew Valley has made it all possible for me.

Someone might have told you that this is an easy going, relaxing game that can be enjoyed by anyone, even those who don't normally play video games. Those people were wrong. For me, Stardew Valley is not really a game at all; it is a mirror, reflecting within it the darkness of the human condition, and my own inability to escape it.   At the time of this review, I have logged 114 hours into this game. I have completed the community center in it's entirety, and I have perfectly optimized my farm for brutal efficiency. I make millions of dollars each season, and, for no good reason, I continue pushing just to see how grotesque and gaudy my industrial hellscape can become. I have never spoken to a single member of the town who cannot benefit me monetarily; if you asked, I would likely only be able to name 5 NPCs at best. I almost never go to the town events and have often found them to simply be obstacles or annoyances in my personal quest for power.  This game may be relaxed for some, but for me, it is war.  There shall be no item left unpurchased, no crop left ungrown, and no slime left unslain. I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.  If you share a desire for ruthless expansion and power, this game is for you. Conversely, if you just want to have a cute little farm and role-play a simple but idyllic rural fantasy, this game is probably also for you. Either way, if you value your mental health, or maintaining *actual* productivity, the abyss is best left un-gazed upon.",1582074447,1582086387,1,435,775,0.92326021194458,22,1,0,0,0,

My parents probably rented the game a dozen+ times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game. My brother and I dumped hours, and hours, and hours into that game. Beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings.    A few years ago, for the first time, a game was released that bested the original Harvest Moon. That game is obviously Fortnite. JK   Stardew Valley is such a good spiritual successor, that it beats the original hand over fist. It's entirely it's own game, while nodding its head to what I assume is its source inspiration. It exceeded my expectations by a lot, and it continues to be improved on again and again. [B] FOR FREE [/B]   This game has a lot of replayability (just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now). Between different relationships, different focuses, different game altering choices, and different property layouts and designs. There's enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time.    It might seem minor, but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best, if not THE best out there. Chrono Cross was my former favorite, but only Stardew Valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases (okay, one of those was a gift). It keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it MIGHT otherwise get sometimes. Its similar to the Tetris song. After enough playing, the music is ingrained in my soul. Lmao   Gorgeous pixel graphics. Amazing variety and loads of charm. The creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way.   This game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets.    11/10 - stop fucking around and buy the game already. I dont care if you find farming boring.  PS - shout out to my brother. He never got to experience this masterpiece, but at least we had good times on Harvest Moon. He would have loved it. RIP 1987-2007",1579583057,1579583193,1,330,19,0.940077543258667,1,1,0,0,0,

It just needs good mechanics. It was a breath of fresh air after years playing Harvest Moon farm sims which, though fun, all have the same issues- somewhat boring archtype characters and only heterosexual marriage options. The villagers in stardew seem like real people you would find in a small rural town- there are drunks, there are homeless people, there are people fighting depression. It tackles the issue of large corporate entities driving out small town businesses and gives you the option to either help or hinder this effort. It does all this while still maintaining a wholesome, bright, and non-stressful atmosphere. There are challenging elements like fighting monsters in the mines and mastering the fishing mini-game. They give you solid goals to work towards so that despite the repetitive elements of the game, you always have something to plan out.

There is so much to do in Stardew Valley, and I appreciate that you can do it all at your own pace. The game can feel a bit daunting at first and you will find yourself playing on one screen and having the wiki open on the other screen. There is so much packed into this game. There’s farming, selling, mining, fighting, crafting, cooking, and building. All of which are done very well aside from the clunky fighting.  Where this game truly shines is in the people that populate the game and the story that unfolds as you get to know each person. Is Shane the town drunk, or just a young man fighting depression and hopelessness? Is Haley a stuck-up princess or will she realize there is a good life in the simple and mundane? Will Leah do something with her art? Will Clint overcome his low self-esteem and ask the girl he pines after out? Is Penny destined to live a hard life with Pam, her alcoholic mother? Why is George such a grump? He will tell you and you will look at him differently afterwards. Will the two secret lovers ever become public? Will Lewis put himself first instead of the town? Will Elliot get the courage to write? Will the governor ever like the town soup? Will Marnie ever be available when you want to buy animals? Nope!  Each character in the game has personality and a story to tell. As through these stories your first impressions of characters may not be the impressions you have of them later in the game. Shane’s struggles hit home for me as did Penny’s longing for a different life.  This game helped me get through some dark times in my life and I am grateful I purchased this during the Steam Summer Sale. I am even more thankful that I took the time to play the game and understand it. Putting in a little effort makes the journey a far more enjoyable experience.  Lastly, the modding community for this game has turned the game into an even better version. There are many mods to choose from and I appreciate all the creators for the work they have put into this wonderful game.

They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.   Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.   Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you  ~EDIT~  A lot of people were upset I didn't share the things I enjoyed about the game in detail. Below you will find my personal experience in the short amount of time I spent playing.  I spent most of my time fighting slimes with a sword and mining the ore in the dungeon.. haha, but I also made some money off plants. I didn't spend much time getting to know the townsfolk. I got irritated that weeds kept growing in my garden, but I kept plucking them and it was sort of rewarding to keep my map weed free. That's about all I can say other than digging up treasures that would show up in the dirt. I had just planted some plant that cost me like 1000 gold, and I built a water irrigation system around that, and my other plants. It was struck by lightning shortly after... lol, my best friend actually played for several hours with me which was unexpected, and since we shared gold he and I kept screwing each other over for fun. I just saw an update that may be fixing that ""issue"" however, and either way I intend to pick up the game again and play it much more in depth when my winter season comes and work slows down.

Almost every aspect of this game seems to have been given serious and careful thought.  Down from the sounds of the environment to the visuals and character stories (yes they exist here). Very well rounded crafting, farming and selling system revolving around the seasons and player levels.  You gain a significant sense of community if you choose to interact with the villagers and help them out. With all those positive said lets look at what could possibly be improved.  These mostly refer to end-game as this game's pace is judged by how you play and therefore you don't miss out on events as they will pop-up when you start working towards them.  Map size? Possible the bus service takes you to more than just Calico Desert. Farm size? Possibly allowing the player to expand the farm as things can get cluttered. The RNG achievements. These should not be as grindy as they are, for people who want to have a perfect farm/collection/friendship points, should be allowed to without having to fish for days on end or hoe-ing at the artifact worms like a madman until all sanity is lost. And Praire King should just be left alone and treated as a separate game altogether.   Otherwise there is not much else that can be improved upon. There are bottle necks with resources if playing with friends, but i find these are necessary as you should have to work hard to get a big, profitable farm going.   An easy 10/10, would recommend for single and multiplayer. GG ConcernedApe who single-handedly made the game over years.  Edit after more hours:  Added loads of mods. Of which there are plenty. Well made one by the community. Would highly recommend as it bring loads of new hours and even objectives in the game. I have ye to try the Stardew Expanded Version which looks amazing!

Stardew Valley allows the player to enjoy the life of a farmer without the drudgery of actually comitting to all that a life of soil entails. It is the synthesized experience, just at the cost of all the heartfelt extrasensory stuff that would otherwise make said toil worth it. There is no fresh air for you the player, it is implied. The food you grow to enrich the community and pallate is processed and cooked instantly, but hardly of use to the player the same way as it would owning a real farm. Jean Baudrillard describes in Simulacra and Simulation (1981) how an emulated experience can and will supersede the reality of what it simulates, if said reality is good enough at filling the same needs/gaps in our hearts/souls/hours. In other words, there is/might not be any real loss loosing the dirt-under-the-nails authentic experience of farming, if we are provided with a simulation that properly pushes our buttons, and we were really into it not for the extra sensory rewards of, say, fresh produce in the first place. Synthetic experiences are by their very nature more pure and efficient, even as they remove and reduce the experience they simulate by removing sensational outliers, be they good or bad. Stardew Valley is in this way, perhaps better at fulfilling the fantasy of farming, than real farming could ever be. All the same however it is only a simulation and poor in lasting experiences ""real"" farming life would be rife with. With all this, the same question keeps rolling over in my head, on and on: Why am I so satisfied with this?  You denominate and play as a person traveling to the countryside to enact change in their lives, to breathe clear air and to do something meaningful with with themselves. In the game you get your lot in order, begin farming and perhaps some light animal husbandry, while getting to know the locals and integrating yourself as part of the community. None of this actually put fresh air in the players lungs, allow them to befriend new people or even eat fresh produce. The sense of accomplishment for this is left however, perhaps stronger than it would be in real life, as the achievement of weeks or months are destilled into hours of playtime. The simulated experience can take liberties with the less favorable parts of the lifestyle. Caring for animals is reduced to petting and harvesting. Cutting weeds is done in determined swoops.  Talking to your neighbors in the Jrpg fashion where listening to short snippets of their life removes any chance of the small social mishaps so common in reality. Is that enough? Is the context of video game simulation enough to settle for this over the real thing? This is what has me worried. Often today we are asked to make concessions of quality to manage to eke out enough catharsis to survive week to week, or even (for some people) day to day. Much of the way modern life is organized is directly harmful to both our physical and mental health, the enivronment, and long term survivability. If context is all it takes to become complacent then there is nothing stopping us from  creating rationalizations for similar concessions of function or form. Part of Baudrillard's discussion of simulacra is specifically that a simulation can become reality if it is ""good enough"" enough. Settling for less, if the cut out bits are unwanted, is in fact more. Robotics, similarly to the Stardew experience, allow the owner to keep the best parts of a labour force, while also cutting out the extraneous awkward aspects that makes for a less effective work environment. A robot does not want/need rights (currently) and does not complain about or demand better working conditions. In such an instance the ratio between human ingenuity, problem solving and flexibility, and effective uncomplaining perpetuity, becomes purely economic. Scaling away the human elements of a workforce is in  fact good economy as it more effectively produces the dopamine of the economy, IE money. The goods quality is perhaps not inconsequential (similarly Stardew Valley is a good game) but again, quality needs to be weighed against the ratio that produces the most dopamine, meaning that trimming quality (real air, real fresh produce) can and will be the most effective alternative when or if the goal is to experience the most painless route to the goal.  Stardew Valley is perhaps better at farming than actual farming from a pure dopamine perspective. Just as cocaine is better at having fun than taking the time to do enjoyable things, and robots are better than humans at working and making money. And that scares the living fuck out of me!",1554920794,1554920794,1,165,29,0.856972455978394,0,1,0,0,0,

Now for the longer one.  I believe when this first came out, I got it as a gift from a friend, and was assured that it was similar ""yet super different"" to a very beloved game of mine: Harvest Moon. Honestly, I didn't touch it for years, viewing most indie games at the time as wastes of money, especially when I was working and in school.  Then, I stopped working, and found myself in an incredibly bad spot mentally. My eating disorder kicked in, I was diagnosed with suicidal depression, with suddenly too much time on my hands and no energy to take up a new hobby. It was my partner who asked if I'd played, he himself picking it up around this time, and it was one soft encouragement of ""you already own it, just try it"" that pushed me to start that first save file.   Game play wise, it's everything I wish Harvest Moon had been; dynamic movements, a simple UI, clear goals and a sense of progression that doesn't ever feel forced or artificial. Farming is one part of it, so if that's not your jive, there are a magnitude of options to make money and grow what I fondly think of as my other life. You never have to get married, although to have adorably pixelated children a spouse is required, and if you'd like to live the lone wolf lifestyle? It allows it. You never have to make friends, unless you like finishing quests, which some of us don't.   The combat is smooth and clean, most times. As you level up, weaker things get easier and the challenges posed to you grow ever more difficult. This mechanic means that if you like the combat (not me), it doesn't seem to get boring, even after level 10. Rewards are abundant, treasure and artifacts and minerals that are needed to get some of the better gear in the game - however, there is a luck system, so be warned about trying to hunt for Iridium on a bad luck day. The fortune teller gives you no lies, and it's' not worth it trying to tempt their readings.   Crops are simple, if not a little tedious in the first year, when you likely have no sprinklers or good fertilizer. Honestly, I'm the type to plan out the farm from day one, but many others throw seeds into large clumps and hey - whatever works for you. Just get used to the sound of running water every time you use the watering can. Many bathroom breaks in the beginning, trust me. Crows won't be an issue after you figure out scarecrows, and as soon as you can craft fertilizer, start basic and put it under everything. I mean it. Crops just die sometimes and when you're like me and want that community center done quickly and efficiently, you'll need every one of them in the first year. Animals are cute, way too cute, and from personal experience in the first year or two they'll make you more money quicker than crops.   Speaking of the community center, or if you're a opportunistic capitalist who doesn't care about small town businesses, Joja Mart Warehouse: finishing it will bring you joy for about ten minutes, until you realize that it does literally nothing and no one uses it. Waste of so many resources and your actual hard earned gold.   Fishing is a pain until suddenly you're good at it and your left-click finger is trained on a hair-trigger, crab pots are useless and I hate them, and there's something so satisfying about spending half an in-game day foraging for berries in the Summer that it's hard for me to describe it in words.   This is a game that is made for downtime, and in my personal belief, does it in a way that's in no way boring or overdone. It's reinvented the ""farming sim"" game to the point where everything else feels lacking. It requires little effort if you don't want to give it, or will lend itself to meticulous planning of crops and other money-making strategies. It's a game that I can sit down with at work for a quick break, or throw myself into for a weekend. Either way, in the words of Marie Kondo, it certainly does spark joy.",1553354667,1553354667,1,137,5,0.886410057544708,1,1,0,0,0,

I was like ""a farming game ? meh ... not really my type ... but i heard so much about it ... okay let's test it"" and that's how it did hit me in the face. Let's be clear here, we have a f**king amazing solo hero game developper in command ! Take a moment to realize this game has been made by a single multi talented guy. I tried to help dev-ing some video game with some friends and that shit is really hard. Combinning code, gameplay imagination, balance, art, music. I was thinking, okay if he really did it all by himself ... im sure he was slacky on music, or sometimes art. Nope and Nope.  The most amazing thing in the game if we take everything in consideration is the music. You can percieve some Mr Uematsu vibe sometimes it's really soozing, nostalgic and very well made.   Mr Concerned Ape, if you read me : thank you for this beautiful, nice and complete game. You did even more than great, and im not a farming game fan. Thank you for including a complete donjon/fight system in that kind of game. Thank you for taking time to work on music and sounds. And please if there is some strength remaining in you, keep adding content ! pleaaaaase ! (Or make another game because you are born for that) some ideas : New areas, new characters, new monsters, new junimo's stories, new crafts, new items. May be adding dunjon bosses ? More complexity on foods effects ? More weapon types (bow, throwing knives, gun ?), armor slot ? head with bonus ? may be even some spells ? i think you can make that rpg part grow even more ! : D   ",1551477070,1551477070,1,89,10,0.84273773431778,0,1,0,0,0,

But for some people, like myself, this game will suck you into the vortex like a hyper-hydraulic toilet on the turbo rinse cycle option.  Now, I have very little experience in this genre of Harvest Moon lookin' farm games. But it's hard for me to imagine that they get much better than this. There's just so much to do that it's hard to fathom. You've gotta clean up your farm so that you got a nice open spot to plant some little potato seeds. Gotta grow those little stink eggs up right quick to make a nice buck at Pierre's store. But what'cha gonna do while you're waiting for the vegetables? Hmm, I don't know, you could get a fishing pole from Ol' Willy and catch some salty sardines or maybe you wanna go into the mines and search for sparkly rock crystals while you fend for your life in the dank depths of the earth.   But this is only the beginning of what's on the agenda. You can build some animal coops and milk some cows, build a stable an' ride a horse, befriend the locals and maybe meet a waifu or husbando. You can rebuild the community center, cook up delicious pizzas and give them to your buddies, maybe even sniff around in the open fields looking for grapes and then EAT them. The choices are yours and the pace at which you take it is yours to decide as well.  Great music, great style, lots to do, and a HEAPING helping of getting sucked right into the vortex of no return. This is what Stardew Valley has to offer. Give it a shot if you're in the mood for losing yourself in the endless EXPANSE of farm fresh manure and infinite anchovies.   To sum things up, I'd give Stardew Valley a solid scoring of ""Outta control like a bull gone ape"" Thanks for reading.",1551079197,1551079197,1,130,29,0.896049499511719,0,1,0,0,0,

Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for him. I remember seeing him playing it from time to time, the message indicating that he'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift. Last September he committed suicide. After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up his computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Stardew Valley. He had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. He had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of cash. It was only then did I see just how much he loved his present. No other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one. None of his friends really knew about it, however; it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself. Like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted.  And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.  I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (i'll ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, with the multiplayer beta, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs.

It was all very fun, challenging and almost addictive honestly. We would lose hours just doing what would normally be mundane tasks, but had fun doing it.

And not only it that it was made by one person, but that every single aspect of the game was so expertly crafted.  The game looks and sounds beautiful, and from what I understand Eric Barone crafted both the art and the music himself. By itself, that's impressive. Then you consider that he programmed the entire game, balanced everything, wrote the characters and dialogue, and filled out this world head-to-toe with fun, satisfying, and interesting activities. If you have any interest in games as a medium beyond just playing and enjoying them, Barone's story is mindboggling.   There are numerous small examples of Barone's craft that make themselves known beyond what normal games of this type display. For example, the way people will allow you to pass them with a small shake if you press into them enough, or the sound effects that play when navigating the menus. These might seem trivial, but they're indicative of the quality of experience here. There is so much polish and character to every aspect of this game, and all of it adds up to make Stardew Valley a masterful experience.  Another example of this depth of quality are the character interactions. I'm a sucker for good character writing. In Stardew, each character that populates the town is expertly written, with deep character backstories that surprised me. Even the characters I initially disliked proved to have more going on underneath the surface. I went into Stardew expecting a pretty straightforward indie farm management experience and I got so much more.  Each pursuit is gratifying as well. I initially hated fishing, but soon grew to enjoy it once I gained basic acumen. Mine-diving and battling monsters provided a satisfying progression as well. And, of course, farming and building your home and land up from being overgrown to being a palace is not only incredibly satisfying but works exceptionally for what you'd expect. I put down Fallout 4 because its settlement system was so awful, Stardew Valley's--although it admittedly has much less going on--Is an absolute dream by comparison. And tying this altogether is the Community Center system, which requires you to plug in specific types of ""loot"" for various rewards. It's what finally got me addicted to Stardew, staying up way too late trying to catch that elusive catfish, or reading the wiki while at work so I could find out how to get specific Artisan goods.  If what you've seen of Stardew Valley has interested you in even the least, you should probably just give it a shot. I thought I knew what it was, but it proved far deeper and more polished than I ever expected a game made by one person could be. And if you liked its spiritual ancestor Harvest Moon, then you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's a phenomenal example of the power of a singular vision when creating art, and another example of the flourishing indie scene that's developed in gaming over the past decade or so.",1542632486,1542632486,1,81,2,0.857924342155457,0,1,0,0,0,

I could've paid $60 for it and I still would be happy with my experience. The developer (ConcernedApe) should be proud of the work he's done here, it's a fantastically enjoyable piece of art.  To start, I played this game cooperatively with my girlfriend from the start to the end. [i]As a side-note, if you're going to play with a friend from the start, you want to enable extra cabins. The extra cabins allow 1 extra player to join you. You can start without cabins and build them super cheaply but, if you're wanting to jump right into it, you'll next the extra.[/i]  I'm a very seasoned gamer having played video games since the original NES. It wasn't too terrible for me to the get the hang out it right out of the box [i]I suggest enabling ""always on targeting marker"" in the options as it will greatly help with properly aiming. Also, make sure you're not standing on the tile you wish to interact with, such as tilling land.[/i] My GF is not a seasoned gamer, this was her second game she's played on PC utilizing a mouse and keyboard. I had her enable the aiming marker as well and she had a relatively easy time figuring out what she was doing for the most part.  There is a ton of stuff to do in this game and you can't go wrong with any of them.  [b]Farming[/b] is easily the most profitable and you don't even need to worry about which crops are the best cash crops. It's very appealing to try to have a crop of each type due to the benefit of cooked food, as well as quests that require various crops. If you only grow one crop, you'll missing out on other aspects of the game.  [b]Fishing[/b] is a bit rough and continues to be a bit rough throughout the game. Some of the fish are a pain to catch and remain a pain to catch but, it's because it costs very little to fish and can yield large payouts should you get good at the fishing mini-game. Crabpots are a great way to raise fishing and acquire 'fish' for other endeavors and easy money.  [b]Mining & Combat[/b] these two are together because, they go hand-in-hand. You go to the mines and later elsewhere and in the process of mining for ore you encounter monsters. You don't become an almighty god amongst mortals in this game, you need to rely on placement, timing, and farming/cooking to help you have the easiest experience, especially once you're done with ""the mines"". [i]Armor is your boots and buffs from food. Your weapons are a melee weapon and ranged weapon, I've never used the ranged weapon in combat. Food restores energy and heals you; your crops and livestock can provide better 'food' that is actually cooked that provides buffs.[/i]  [b]Villagers[/b] are an important part of this game and you want to work on becoming friends with them. There's a calender in town square next to a job board, keep track of birthdays, find out what people like, and given them those gifts. Doing so leads to extra content within the game. [u]It's completely worth it.[/u]  [b]Foraging[/b] is actually beneficial and provides a source of income, food, and goods. You use your hoe on 'worm tiles' and you receive items typically for the museum. I suggest doing this as it can give you a leg up on making money and give you access to things that you couldn't get yet.  All-in-all I'd say I love this game. My girlfriend loves this game. It's been an enjoyable experience for a seasoned gamer and someone new to gaming. They did it right with this one and deserve all the praise they get. If you can play with one extra person, farm life will be exceptionally easier. For each extra person, the more specialized you can get. Fishing is always relevant, mining is always as well. Farming is only useful as long as you can grow crops and have money for the seeds (or get a seed maker). With two people we were able to get a large portion of the content done, we're just down to getting the last pieces of 'end game gear' and wrapping up maxxing out friendships.  A few tips if you do decide to get into it. [list] [*]Enable always on targeting marker. [*]Don't stand on the tile you're tilling. [*]If you have nothing better to do, go mining. [*]Work on friendships. [*]Work on the community center. [*]Grow all the varied crops. [*]Don't be afraid of the wiki, crops were my usual pages. [*]Play with a friend if you can. Make a friend to play this with if you don't have one. [*]All options are valid. [*]Upgrade the watering can first (gold if you can) [*]Upgrade the hoe next (gold too but, not as important as watering can) [*]Don't worry about buying too much equipment for the mines, just bring food for healing/energy. [*]The upgraded backpack is [b]SO[/b] worth it, especially while mining. [*]Don't concern yourself too much with min-maxing, it doesn't really matter. [*]Be patient, take your time. [*]If you're going to the mines, try to make 5 levels each time you go, the elevator saves progress every 5. [*]Gather all of your crops no later than the 28th (they all day next season except some.) [*]All crops die in winter. [*]Store at least a couple of everyone. I kept the highest tier I could get, sold the rest. [*]Use winter for mining and reorganizing (most useful for solo or duo play.) [*]Most of all, have fun and relax. Don't stress too much. [/list]  There's tons more tips but, this is a review. :P  It's a great game, worth every dollar. I don't regret buying this full price. The devs deserve it and I hope they can make another great game like this. Sci-fi next time hopefully!",1539674614,1541122338,1,120,2,0.906320691108704,11,1,0,0,0,

You don't have to improve it if you don't want to. Maybe all you want is to fish and hang out with Abigail. Or maybe you just want to fight slimes 'till you pass out. Hell, maybe you just want to get drunk and bring the wizard presents. You do you, dog. This game ain't gonna judge.   There's just so much to do in this game. In the absence of a contemporary Animal Crossing, it's easy to see why it's been such a massive success. What it does is basically take all the heart and spirit of AC and place it within a more relaxed version of Harvest Moon's infrastructure. That's just the basic setup though. The real genius is in the way the gameplay is paced. Taking a cue from Civilization's 'one more turn' mantra, this game is played over a succession of in-game days for which you have a limited amount of stamina to carry out the many different little actions that you can take. These days, essentially bite-sized segments of gameplay, gradually add up to shape a deeply personal experience that feels very unique to the player. That's the killer app here: your farm, your village, your relationships, and your trajectory along the seasons all feel tied up to the decisions you take and the activities you choose to do or not do, day by day. You can breeze through days if you want, just picking up crops and sleeping before noon even hits. Or you can take it slow and optimize each day, cramping in as many activities as you can with your limited stamina. It's all up to you.  This game will also take you by surprise in the ways that it can engage you. Personally, I was worried at first because farm building never really enthused me as a mechanic (in fact, the whole aspect of decorating/improving your house in AC is something I never connected with either). But this game has so much more than just keeping your farm. It's got a good fishing system, which I greatly appreciated. It's got a mine to explore and engage in combat. It has a museum for you to fill in with fossils and other tidbits. It has a house full of mini challenges each with its own reward that will keep you busy for weeks.   And then there's the dating. My god, this game has some good writing. The denizens of Stardew Valley are a family you'll come to know very well, and each one of them has an interesting line you can follow as you strengthen your friendships with them. As you can imagine, the progression for these relationships is pretty straightforward (you just gift them stuff). But the real meat is in the little scenes that play when you hit the milestones in the relationships. Some of them will stay with me for a long time.  There's just so much value here. It truly feels like an evolution in the genre, with its more palpable and personal progression and the way it doesn't string you around or punish you for any way of using your time. You'll play this game and wish you could have this simple, tranquil life. Considering the game's intro and mission statement, I call that a home run.",1535947181,1535947284,1,91,6,0.898516476154327,1,1,0,0,0,

An independently developed title that I've noticed over the past year or so becoming increasingly more and more popular among my friends, and the gaming community as a whole. From its days in early access as a single player investment, to what is now an enjoyable experience that traverses the dichotomy between that, as well as Multiplayer. Whatever flavor you prefer - or even if you're ambidexterous in your pallate, so to speak - there is guaranteed to be something here for anyone who is in the market for what is, by all intents and purposes, a farm-focused life simulator. Normally $14.99 in the Steam Marketplace, I was hoping to hold out for another sale of $5.99. But seeing as it just wasn't going much lower, and I had apparently missed my window, I picked my copy up during the Summer Sale of 2018 for a [i]VERY[/i] slight discount of $11.99. But the upshot of that? It was worth every penny of the investment.  [b]Story:[/b]  You play as an unknown entity of your creation. Your grandfather is dying, and has presented to you in his final moments an envelope. Later on, dragged down by the hardships of life in the city, working in an office for the JoJa Corporation (this game's version of Wal-Mart, essentially), you decide one day to open this envelope. Within, you are bequeathed a deed to your grandfather's old cottage in the rural community of Stardew Valley. Acting from that moment, you leave your old life behind, and move out there to start everything anew. From herein, the plot can go literally [i]wherever you choose[/i]. Not in the sense that you can kill the mayor, put the townsfolk in a labor camp, and run your own modern day, Far Cry 5-esque, Jim Jones style dictatorship mind you, but a direction that opts for normalcy. A simple member of a grassroots community, cultivating a peaceful, personally successful lifestyle under your own terms. Grow your farm, raise animals, go fishing, dabble in the supernatural, explore the mines, make friends, get married, have kids. It's all up to you [i]what[/i] you decide, and [i]how[/i] you decide to do it.  [b]Gameplay:[/b]  If you're more accustomed to modern day, 3D games with top of the line graphics that tell you what to do, how to do it, and where you have to go in order to get it done, you're already in for a sharp, left hand, 90 degree learning curve. Stardew Valley is absolutely [i]none[/i] of those things, and the beauty of it is that it doesn't [i]need[/i] to be, either. As it's presented, Stardew Valley revives - and modernizes - the core sensibilities of games such as [i]Harvest Moon[/i] back in the 1990's, and [i]Animal Crossing[/i] in 2003 before it. Drawing parallels, but at the same time, foraging a new path which has proven it's mettle in the modern age to not only work, but also resonate. People get sick of the same thing, day in and day out after awhile, and with the current kickback to retro style gaming in 2018, this could not have come along at a better time. Now granted, there is a little bit of a grind to this game, and you can easily wear out its welcome if you're not careful. Player choice in dialog, as well - while acceptable - certainly doesn't present itself as often as I would personally love to see it. But for capping it off at even a few hours a day of playing, there is certainly enough content within it to stave away any sense of boredom. And it will get no complaints from me, except in one solidary aspect, which is the horrible fishing minigame. I've been told that it can be mastered with some persistence, but where everything else is a peaceful foray into farm fresh living, it can be absolutely jarring. Like going on a walk through a nature reserve, and getting clocked in the back of the head with a 2X4. Long story short, however, if you're getting angry at a game like this, you know something's wrong. I had to literally mod out the feature in order to continue progressing (which is to say, in no disrespect to those who prefer an exclusively vanilla experience, this is another favorite aspect of this game for me).  [b]Audio:[/b]  The sound effects in the game don't require a whole lot of exposition. But they are wonderfully produced, and are absolutely acceptable, with nothing sounding out of place whatsoever. I could, however, go on for days about the music. And that, as well, doesn't have any qualms from my end either. The theme of the main menu, the music in the Fall and Winter seasons, the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies at the end of Summer - there are just so many good songs in this game that evoke so many good feelings that you just can't help but like them, no matter who you are or what you're normally into as far as that stuff goes. You would have to literally be a sociopath to not enjoy the soundtrack to this game. Knowing all the more that this was the work of only one man - Eric of ConcernedApe - only adds to how impressive the collection is. Especially from the perspective of someone who has also created his own music in the past, which was maybe 1/10th of this level of quality at best. Highly recommended.  [b]Optimization:[/b]  Aside from some very miniscule frame drops in OBS Studio whenever I stream this game on Twitch, there's no quandries. You would literally have to be running a rotten potato for this game to not be well optimized. Even my Dell Inspiron, a laptop which boasts an Intel Pentium Dual-Core Processor @ 2.14 GHZ and 4 GB of RAM, runs the game without any issues whatsoever at its full resolution of 1366x768, just the same as on my desktop, which has a GTX 1070, i7-4790k and 16 GB of RAM in complete contrast. All in all, very much to be expected of a game like this.  [b]Rating:[/b]  As of my previous review of [i]911 Operator[/i], I rate all of my games on the following scale:  [table] [tr] [th]Rating[/th] [th]Summary[/th] [/tr] [tr] [td]5 out of 5[/td] [td]Perfect on every level, or damn close to it. The fun factor completely overshadows the very few, if any shortcomings, and the overall product is, without debate, worth the full asking price.[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]4 out of 5[/td] [td]Above Average. While it's still a good, if not great product, there are noticeable issues here and there. Worth full price, but if you can rent it on console, watch gameplay online, or wait for a sale on PC, even better.[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]3 out of 5[/td] [td]Average. The caveats are on equal ground with the amount of entertainment provided. Rent it on console, watch gameplay online, or wait for a sale on PC.[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]2 out of 5[/td] [td]Fair. The problems with the overall product are noticeable, and outweigh the fun factor on most levels. Watch gameplay of it online if you must, or rent it on console. Deep sale on PC at absolute best.[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]1 out of 5[/td] [td]Poor. The product is an unmitigated disaster with very little, if anything, to be lauded. Unless you're a masochist, the best recommendation I can possibly give is to watch gameplay of it online. Don't waste your money.[/td] [/tr] [/table]  [b]Overall Score for Stardew Valley:[/b] 4 out of 5. That fishing minigame - again - is horrible for me, and it digs enough into my personal experience that giving it a perfect 5 out of 5 would just be lying to myself. And the overall grind is also something that you've got to be in the mood for, as previously stated. But the former can be corrected through the use of mods (or just being really damn good, one of the two), and the latter only becomes an issue with long hours of gameplay, to be perfectly frank. I imagine multiplayer makes it a more streamlined experience, and probably closer to a perfect 5, but I will have to revisit this one day after I get the opportunity to try it out. As of 08/22/18, however, speaking solely in terms of the single player experience, this is my final score. And you would be completely remiss to not buy this game right now. Although, a decent discount never hurt anything either. It's all up to you.",1534929883,1534930297,1,49,4,0.811579883098602,1,1,0,0,0,

43678538,413150,Stardew Valley,76561198102136663,407,47,9547,0,8163,1667753085,english,"Stardew Valley is a Farming Simulator. That sort of sums it up and sort of doesn't even scratch the surface.  The game has cute, charming visuals, relaxing music and nice sound design. Due to the pixel graphics, some animations (especially interactions with NPCs) can look a bit off, but that's not a massive issue. Character customization is surprisingly extensive with a choice between male or female, various hairstyles, a bunch of shirts, and sliders to adjust hair, eye, and pants colour.  After creating your character you start off on a run-down farm that your dead grandfather left you. You clean it up, buy seeds, plant crops, all to make money to improve the farm. Aside from farming, there's fishing, mining and combat; you can interact with the town NPCs, eventually get married and have kids (which are entirely useless and stop aging after reaching the toddler stage, so no free labour). You have five different skills as well which improve when doing the related tasks. Basically, it [i]is[/i] a farming sim, and you can just ignore everything around that, but there's a lot more to do than I first expected.  The game had a co-op mode added a while after release; it works well enough and makes the game a lot more enjoyable.  Here's the thing. When I first played Stardew Valley, I thought it was boring and didn't bother much until the co-op came out. After playing a bit with friends, I went back to my single-player farm and ... just couldn't stop for a long while. It does what it does pretty well, and it's very relaxing. It's also quite satisfying; the little sounds it makes when you water your crops or harvest them, seeing your money go up every day, watching your farm develop and your animals grow up. It somehow manages to avoid being too boring, even when you do mostly the same things every day; there is still a sense of progression, and you can choose between different (albeit limited) activities whenever you get tired of what you were doing before.  What's honestly still tedious more than anything is the relationship system. Whenever you give one of the townsfolk a gift, you gain points (because we all know the best friendships are a result of throwing mayonnaise at someone on a daily basis); if you just talk to them every day, you get a much smaller amount. If you ignore them, however, you will [i]lose[/i] points. Before advancing relationships, talking to the NPCs is pretty boring as they mostly say the same lines over and over.  Now these townspeople don't just sit and wait for you. They wander around in town and the surrounding areas, which makes it more irritating to try and find them because either you memorize their schedules or look them up on the wiki every time. If you don't use a mod that shows them on the map, you'll probably get frustrated. On the bright side, interactions at higher friendship ""levels"" are well thought-out and quite adorable in some cases, even with non-romance NPCs. (There are a few mods that aren't cheating, but make some aspects of the game a lot less tedious.)  I suppose I recommend the game, but you might want to stay away if you have an addictive personality or get annoyed when your friends dig up the entire farm for no reason.",1532260079,1606473395,1,78,8,0.808637499809265,1,0,0,0,0,

I’ve never played a Harvest Moon game or an Animal Crossing game, and never had any interest in them. The closest thing to a farming game I’ve ever played was Minecraft. I definitely would have never tried Stardew Valley if I wasn’t an achievement hunter and it didn’t have achievements.   But now I see what all the hype was about.  Stardew Valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into. There are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life, especially the game’s premise: you’re stuck at a soul-crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies, leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you’ve reached your absolute limit and need something new. After a particularly bad day at work, you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather’s farm on a far-off island, so you take the plunge and decide to move there. It is a very strong analogy to the game itself, where you, the player, are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game, not knowing what else to expect.  In Stardew Valley, you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land. As the days go by, you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you’ve been given, from buying seeds and planting crops, to raising animals, to fishing (by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event), to foraging for wild food, and even to exploring a few combat-centric Zelda-style dungeons. But you’re not making money for its own sake – there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land, each with significant and game-changing rewards at the end, and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all. The game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first. Although you’ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time, it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can.  Years consist of four months, each month being 28-day season. Some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons, particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons, and (almost) no crops grow in winter, so you’ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when. Each day lasts about five minutes, and you’ve got to make sure you’re back in your house by 2AM, or else you’ll pass out and lose some money. The biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the [i]start[/i] of a day – so if you’re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops, it won’t mean anything unless you play the whole day through. A vicious cycle! I clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing. That’s how bad it is.  Another one of the game’s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside, with a population of about 25 people. The game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity, with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations. You’ll really get to know and love them. You can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them, unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards. You can even date some of them (you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want, no joke; relationships are gender-indiscriminate) and then marry the character of your choice. The social aspect is sometimes a bit too real – you’ll feel the pain of rejection all too often – but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming.  As for complaints: surprisingly, the game has some strange and baffling bugs, most of which are visual (like ice-skating horses), but some which affect gameplay, and a few known save-corruption bugs. I also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls. If you're using the mouse, your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character, or else you'll only aim at the tile in front of you, making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working. And if you accidentally click the wrong tile, your character will turn to face it, changing the default direction you aim, compounding the problem. It can be infuriating, especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops. Also, I don't like how you can only talk to NPCs if you have a tool selected, and how you'll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected. The controls could definitely use some additional polish.   Then there are the inventory controls. If you click on an inventory item, you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot. If you click on an inventory item with a storage box open, you will immediately transfer the item into (or out of) the box. Thus, it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open. If you click on an inventory item while in a shop, [i]you immediately sell the item with no confirmation[/i]. I can't tell you the amount of times I purchased 200 seeds, then immediately sold them again just because I tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot.  Also, I can’t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does – perhaps more dungeons, a bigger map, and the ability to run more than one farm. But (as of this writing) the game is still in active development, including a co-op multiplayer patch in the works, and a lively modding community.  I give this game an 8/10. A wonderful example of what all those crappy Farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses. Despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls, it’s some simply wonderful escapism, and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game. It does get stale in time, but not before offering a huge amount of joy. For achievement hunting, it’ll easily take about 200 hours, especially blind… but if you’re like me, you’ll have it over with in a month or two. A huge thumbs-up.",1531589714,1531605117,1,445,12,0.945586919784546,12,1,0,0,0,

The game for me was almost a little like inception.... as one of the reasons I game is to escape. To get away from the stress and pressures of everyday life, work and other. In Stardew Valley, you do just that!   The opening cut scene reveals a character who is unhappy with a dead end job and seemingly no prospects. Until they find a letter from their late grandfather - bequeathing them a farm in Stardew Valley, something he himself went and escaped to in his lifetime. And you go, and you farm, you learn what works, what doesn't, you meet people, you make friends, and if you work hard at it, maybe more. You go fight monsters, you learn to fish, you help people, but you are never bored (except maaaaaaaybe in winter) as there are *always* things to be done on a farm. And there's plenty to explore as well.   The thing I like about the game are the layers in here. As you become invested in your character you learn about the villagers you've moved near to; they each have their own backstories., which you find out both directly and indirectly. They each have things they love, things they hate, people they like too. It's a reminder what life *could* (and in the past in some places, was) be like.   And it has a *lot* of replayability value - yes you'll go back in understanding the farming and some of the mechanics, but that gives you freedom to make different choices, and concentrate on other things.... so move on up and settle yourself in to Stardew Valley and regain some lost sanity and some hope.",1529740714,1529740714,1,185,5,0.890922486782074,0,1,0,0,0,

All of this sounds great, so why is it ""deceiving?""   After you've played the game for a while, you start to notice something: there's only a few areas you can go to. There's your farm, the town, the woods, the beach, the mountains, and if you have the bus stop running again, you can go to the desert. However, this ""city"" that's mentioned so many times, and is even shown once, is completely inaccessable, as is the rest of the outside world.  At first, you will just ignore this fact. It's not significant yet, and there's plenty of exploration to be done.   However, as you continue playing and get past a couple of years, something else starts to become apparent.  Nobody changes at all. Not a single person will age; the children that are present stay children forever, the old man in the wheelchair never dies, and nobody grows up. The only exceptions to this rule are your children; however, once at a certain point they will stop aging forever. No amount of years ever changes any of this; you could go to 1000 years and nothing will have changed.  You will also notice that there is no way to die. You can eat poisonous mushrooms, but all they'll do is make you pass out from exhaustion. You can have your health lowered to 0 by taking too much damage from hostile creatures, but you'll just end up in the hospital and lose some stuff from it. You cannot die by starvation, freezing, drowning, dehydration, burning, and you can never get sick with anything.  You are immortal, immune to death or aging, as is everyone else in the game. You will forever be condemned to life, eventually rendering any and all activities boring beyond comprehension, and there will never be an end to this boredom. By moving into the town, the worst curse to ever be conceived has been forced upon you, as with its other residents.   While your grandfather's death suggests that escape is the only way to be freed of this suffering, this task is impossible for you. The only place the bus can take you is to the desert and back to town. You cannot escape by following the road, as an invisible forcefield blocks the way. There is no path to the outside, and you cannot teleport out by magic.  The true antagonist of Stardew Valley is your grandfather. He is the one who tricked you to move to his farm. He forced you into this life, while ensuring his own immunity. He is the true mastermind of this world. The only purpose you serve and will ever serve is being a source of entertainment for him; you are the embodiment of an act of infinite foolishness, and are thus a matter of infinite comedic value.   There is no freeing yourself from this torture. You are left to the agony that is life for as long as time exists, unable to express your pain. Meanwhile, your grandfather, the sole survivor of this hell, forever laughs at you from the afterlife.       It was all a trap, and you fell for it.    This is the true story of Stardew Valley.",1526001660,1526001660,1,451,1403,0.859898447990417,40,1,0,0,0,

Anywhere from daily stress, to severe social anxiety, just taking a step back and immersing yourself into the wonders of the Valley/Pelican Town is calming, relaxing, and peaceful. There are so many different aspects of the game that can help with so many different things that one may be experiencing. Because of this, I truly believe that this game is a work of true art, love, and dedication, that ConcernedApe poured his time, blood, sweat and tears into. On that note, if you are looking for a game that is a time waster, helpful coping mechanism, or just all round freakin' fun, I would highly recommend this game. It's worth every single cent.

I adored both of these games when I was growing up and this, in my opinion, feels like the perfect match to go with their themes. Farming, mining, ranching, monster slaying, ""seducing"" villagers with mainly cheap items, and even a bit of secret to it and it can actually make you obsess over it. My boyfriend even thought I was stupid for liking it so much but now he is at about 50 hours or so on his account and is addicted to the monsters and mining, finishing his skills before me.   Gameplay: Pretty smooth and can vary thanks to a mechanic of luck, giving reason to go mining or even play games at the Saloon for a super difficult game(Bad Luck) or even seemingly easy game(best luck). The fishing is a little bit touch and go at times but is pretty easy compared to the fishing mechanic of Feel The Snow, another game I enjoyed a bit too much.  Soundtrack: Relaxing pretty much all the time, setting you into a relaxed mood. The sounds get eery in the mines, but still can keep you calmer than a horror game. The sounds for rainy days confused me at first but now are obvious clues as to the weather of the day. Overall, pretty great music as it should be for this style of game but better than I expected for the graphics.  Story: Although it is a big chunk of dialogue and farming (almost literally) for the items involved with the Community Center ""Ending,"" there was a lot that I found to be lack luster. It wasn't as long as I thought it would be. The time I spent on this game itself, at current being over 250 hours, wasn't to just get the items for the CC completion and the Joja completion (although that badge didn't come through). The after story takes a short time at the point of where I was, but also adds a tiny bit of extra backstory on a character you encounter.  Mechanics: There are not only easter eggs and exploits in-game, but also kind of cheeky mechanics in this game. It can be somewhat hard to understand first off but with the help of the options menu's disable/enable features, i.e. Zoom, Show Hit Marker, etc., it can turn into a semi-easy game with pretty simple mechanics.  Overall: Although I had some hiccups with the game, I enjoyed and still enjoy all of it. Even the fact of the title screen having too many easter eggs to even spoil as they blur together. Thank you, dev ConcernedApe and publisher/co-dev ChuckleFish for the release of this game. It really brought back some nostalgia.  Now comes the real question, will you, reader, be good or bad?

But this one is an exception, I fell in love with it from the very beginning. Relaxing gameplay, relaxing music, you can do whatever you like and there’s so many things to do.  Gameplay is where the fun is. There are many activities in the game. You can saw the field with vegetables, berries, flowers or whatever, water it every day and wait until it grows. Then harvest them and choose what to do, you can simply sell everything or make pickled vegetables, use it in one of your recipes to make some tasty food and maybe even share it with others. You can have animals and take of them by feeding them. Like cattle or chickens and make mayonnaise from the eggs. Got bored from growing plants or collecting eggs? Go cut the trees and collect wood to build a fence so that your chickens wouldn’t run around your farm or upgrade your house or go fishing and hope for the treasure. There’s also cooking and recipe collecting. You can cook dishes from the resources you grow or collect then consume or sell them. Other activity is getting social with locals, doing requests for them and improving you friendship, maybe even marrying one of them in the end and have a nice family. Don’t forget to decorate your house, you don’t want to bring a girl to your shack like some dirty peasant after all. Another activity is fighting monsters in the dungeons and collecting ores and crystals. It will take a while to finish the dungeons but it's a good change from all the farming.  Time never stops here except for holiday events where you have special tasks. So you need to plan your daily activities. You can’t go everywhere and do everything. You either go all social or go to a dungeon or take care of your plants and animals, there’s not enough time for everything, if you push yourself too hard you pass out.  Graphics. Well I still prefer modern graphics but modern graphics doesn’t always look better, it can be ugly as fuck. This pixel style looks decent enough and I don’t think the developer could’ve made such game with cool modern graphics with a small budget, so I always say “if you don’t have a budget for good looking modern graphics, go artistic style then”. Still i prefer My Time at Portia looks.  The game has quite a big modding community so there are some good mods. Check out nexus for the mods.  I recommend this game for everyone, I think most people should like it more or less.

In Stardew Valley you'll start with creating your own character, choosing from different hairstyles, clothes and select if you're more of a dog or cat-person. After that, you'll escape your dull city-life and move to the farm you inherited from your grandpa. Doesn't look like much in the beginning, but that will change over time.  You'll probably start off clearing out the space around your farm, chopping wood, cutting grass and mine some stone, then putting some seeds into the ground, watering them and wait for the harvest. To skip that time, you can head to the nearby village and get to know all the different characters in town, give them presents to increase their friendship and find out more about them through small cutscenes which appear after you reached a certain friendship level. There are also a handful of single ladies and men which you can marry later on and get children with.  If you are not so keen on farming, you can also build barns and coops and buy animals. They will produce goods as well (eggs, wool, milk etc). Fishing is also an option, which requires to solve a little mini-game.  Or you could head into the nearby mine to get some coal, gold/iron/bronze-ore and other things. But beware! The mine houses some monsters like bats, slimes, skeletons and more which will attack you if you're close enough, so don't forget to pack a sword and some food to replenish your health.  Everything you harvest and mine can normally also be used for artisan goods, which will require different equipment you need to craft first, but in exchange will give you goods that can be sold for a higher profit (or used to craft other things like food).  There is plenty to do in Stardew Valley, to explore, to craft, people to talk to and a lot to enjoy. Of course, at some point, tasks can get repetitive and even tedious, but you also have a lot of goals to strife towards from upgrading your house, getting friendship up with all the people, catching all the legendary fish or furnishing your house.  It's a beautiful game in which you can sink a lot of hours into. Get it as soon as possible ;)",1517219610,1517219610,1,106,3,0.87544059753418,3,1,0,0,0,

This game's simple premise of rebuilding the family farm in a particularly quaint village with an array of fun character's to interact with never feels old. Much of the game is spent trying to make your farm plot perfect to your liking while attempting to maintain relationships with the townfolk. Stardew plays at any pace you want to play at and that is especially rewarding, you will find yourself prioritizing and making chore lists and juggling all of your other duties, but you will do so in a natural rhythym of your own pace and comfort. I am highly awaiting the arrival of the multiplayer update as currently I'm playing with my significant other using a mod for multiplayer - while the mod works, the legitimate update will be much more welcomed! I can't recommend this game enough and once multiplayer is released, I dare say this will be a must-own game for gaming couples!  Edit: Multiplayer has been released and is as amazing as we'd all hoped. This game is an absolute must for all gaming couples. While the multiplayer adds additional player cabins to your property that act as your guest(s) home, they can still sleep in the host's bed and use the main house as if it were their own.",1516417947,1542895768,1,672,14,0.935375213623047,21,1,0,0,0,

Even though it appeals more to casual gamers, this game has a lot to offer.  Whether you are interested in combat, farming, fishing, socializing, etc., Stardew Valley has is the thing.  I must begin by saying that the art style of the game is just purely beautiful. I can't think of something that would fit better for a game like Stardew Valley. It's really neat, seeing games that aren't afraid to take a more minimalistic approach and succeed. The soundtrack is also a key element in the experience, and it delivers. Not only does it perfectly fit the game's atmosphere, but it is also one of those soundtracks you'll dearly listen to even outside of the game.  The premise of the game is simple. Life in the city finally overwhelms you. You decide to open the last gift your grandfather gave you before he died. He left you his farm in Stardew Valley, and so your journey begins. You are greeted by an abandoned plot of land which you must restore to its former glory and by the nice little community of Pelican Town, a small town near your farm. So you start discovering the joy of a simple life there, day by day, as you slowly but steadily  gain the trust of the citizens, turn a profit from the crops you grow back at your farm and join the Adventurer's Guild to fight the threats in a nearby mine. Saying more would spoil the beauty of discovering that little community on your own.  The gameplay is straightforward: you take care of your plot of land to grow crops and that's about it. No end goal. No limits. No hand-holding. You are left to discover the beautiful life in Pelican Town bit by bit, since you can do pretty much everything you'd want to. The controls and mechanics are simple, but sometimes less is more.  The one thing that I really liked about the game was the passage of time. You get to enjoy all of the seasons, each of them coming with its perks and disadvantages. You get to grow different crops based on the season you currently play through and the npc's also react differently. There's holidays to be celebrated, friendships to be discovered and romance to be had!   If you think you can enjoy a relaxing, slow-paced game like Stardew Valley, then go ahead and buy it, do yourself a favour. Altough the game might not be for everyone, it is certainly worth a try. But be careful, It may become quite addicting :)  TL;DR: A nice little game about life in a small town, with plenty of combat, farming, socializing and much more. Build your farm from scratch and start making profit, try to solve the mystery behind Pelican Town or even get married. Truly the best experience for when you just want to unwind from a long day and play a nice little peaceful game. Stardew Valley has a bit of everything, for everyone.",1514499578,1514660997,1,231,6,0.914363265037537,11,1,0,0,0,

I bought this on PS4 first and I've sunk more than 200 hours into it, no joke. At this point, you don't need my review. If you're thinking of buying the game, the rest of the reviews here are stronger advocates than mine. But I'm giving my take on it anyway because this game deserves it.   I started playing because I was exhausted at work (17 days in a row) and stressed out af. My roommate had started playing it and the way he talked about it made me want to pick it up. I liked Harvest Moon. I expected it to be similar. It is, and it isn't.  First impression: soundtrack is super chill. It's just very...nice. Serene, the most relaxing shit I've ever heard. Sometimes, and I'm not even kidding, I put my headset on and head to the seaside and just pause the game. I nap in RL. The sounds of the ocean are just THAT perfect. Same with the rain.   Mechanics: It was kind of frustrating to hit the wrong grid square, but you learn pretty quickly to turn on the target square, and then you only miss if you get too impatient. I find the controls a little more difficult on the computer, but that's only because I've mostly been a console gamer my whole life, and likely because I haven't quite figured out the best way to configure it for PC. I'm having a hard time switching between tools, and it's probably my own fault, but it makes it a slower play for me on PC vs. PS4.   That said, there's great diversity for what you can do, and you can totally do what you enjoy most: farming, mining, fishing, foraging, socializing, etc, with a great system of progression that gives you in-game bonuses and unlockable material.   Story: *mind blown* Harvest Moon had a cheap plot line you didn't even have to pay attention to and one-dimensional lifeless love interests who only exist to provide the next generation of banana farmer. Stardew Valley has AMAZING depth of characters. At first glance, you see a bunch of people you barely know anything about except for the all-important first impression. Shane's a drunken jerk, Sebastian is emo, Penny is quiet and bookish, etc. But as you get to know them better and spend more time with them throughout the game, the characters reveal bits about their past that are at times too real.   ***IMPORTANT: This game actually allows same sex relationships, which is fucking awesome. THANK YOU ConcernedApe!***  I chose Sebastian for my main playthrough. None of the other guys appealed to me, though I did consider Sam. Spoilers ahead.   Sebastian was stand offish. He's one of the hardest to connect with, as he rarely leaves his room and spends the majority of his time on the computer. I correctly assumed he was a brain, and I correctly chose to try to impress him with cool rocks I found in the mines. Eventually, he told me he was a freelancer on his computer, and he is aggravated so many people think he's in his room just playing around (even I assumed this). His mom is remarried. Maru is his half sister, and he is emo because she gets more attention than he does. Makes sense. She has both her parents and she clearly takes after her dad (they're both into science). Sebastian plays music with his buddy Sam, but they also play tabletop RPG.   What really hit home for me, though, is Sebastian's obvious depression. I'm married IRL, and my husband has pretty bad depression, so watching Sebastian struggle with it only made me love him more. Some mornings, Sebastian gives me coffee and helps around the farm. Some mornings, he says he's going for a walk, and he doesn't really like to be bothered while he's on his walk. He likes to have that time to himself. There were days where I really worried about him because he seemed so checked out.  And then there were days where he was so vibrant, I felt better about how things were going. One morning I woke up and he was like, ""I changed the wallpaper. Do you like it?""  ...  I decorated my house in some nice earthy colors with a splash of blue or green here and there. Sebastian wallpapered my house with skeletons. But I was so happy he'd finally made part of the house his own that I redecorated the whole house to match.   The main line of the game is JoJaMart vs. Community, too, and you can complete the game no matter which path you take, which felt REALLY GOOD when the community really came together.   Suggestions: I'm really loving the artisan goods, refining my farm goods to make fancier goods. I love my wine- and beer-making hobby. My only wish is that there was more to do post-game. I have ALL OF THIS MONEY and nothing to do with it now. If I could even invest it in something, that would be nice. I want to tweak my beer and wine to make fancier beer and wine. I want more diverse things to plant (where are the carrots?) Or maybe customize the farm more. My only sorrow is that I feel like I've accomplished everything now and my only option is to start a new farm, so on PS4 I have stopped playing. I am enjoying my restart on Steam, though, reliving my joy all over again.   And I know they are working on multiplayer and some other new stuff, so I am hopeful that future content will bring us Stardew Veterans more to do.   All in all, this game brought me so much happiness during one of the lowest points of my life. It is well worth what it costs, and I'm excited that I can play it on so many platforms. So why do I own two PS4s? I heard Stardew was released on the Switch, so I was an hour into the road trip to go buy a Switch because it was out of stock where I live and my husband was buying Persona 5 to play on our *one* PS4. On the journey to the Switch, I discovered it wasn't yet available for Switch, but I was NOT giving up my Stardew time, Persona 5 or not. So we bought a second PS4. And the Switch. And Persona 5 (and some other things...lololol).    If you don't own this game yet, you need to. I'm so invested in the characters that I even went back to fan fiction.

Hearing the hype from my limited circle, althought the hype isn't that high just a tad warm, I approach the game expecting some kind of tame nostalgia over a mediocre genre kitsch.  I couldn't be more wrong.  To begin with, and in all fairness, this game is indeed a genre kitsch. Heavily reminiscing the old days of Harvest Moon yet this game does it extraordinarily well. So well that it exceeds its kitsch-ness aspect delivering a solid and charming experience. This is the case where copying a nostalgic feels didn't resort into nostalgia bait but it, somewhat, surpasses what it copies turning itself into something new. Harvest Moon genre is still a classic for me and Stardew Valley manages to simulate that classics and turn it into something so well.  I bought this game at full price in skepticism. Now after all the tine I spent and taking a break from playing for months I feel like the price does did justice. The overall quality sure doesn't warrant any high budgeted game but its charm are what makes this game worthy of praise. I haven't even mention the fact that ConcernedApe did this on his own.  Gameplay wise, I love the control, the progression, the learning curve and the rewards. It all feels balanced and fair. Though after getting the gist of it the game turns easy it still rewards me, the player, by its sandobx-y elements. When you're rich and capable then you're privileged to challenge yourself, challenge yourself to tidy up your farm. That's what fantastic about the gaming experience. First you begin with nothing, learning all the way to warrant that privilege, and eventually you became master of everything all that's left is to challenge yourself. Through that process of learning you're given a set of goals and charming characters that you're ended cared so much by the time you've became that master.  In my three playthrough I ended up following the same pattern and I'd say that's a rewarding and satisfying experience in itself.  Though to be fair, I'd like to nitpick a bit. And this might be hugely subjective that I found from personal playthrough. Events and dialogue branch. I'm not talking about the Joja/community cebter branch but the character branch. This game offers a great setting to roleplay but the lack of recognition to the PC profile kinda disturbs the immersion of roleplaying for me. To put it frank, playing a gay character and a straight character offers little to no difference in dialogue and that's a bit of nitpicking from my side.  I'm not planning to writw an in-depth review, I'm just rambling over these ideas about Stardew Valley. I've been thinking to write this ever since I got so hooked to the game but always refraining to do so. Now I decided to ramble a bit --to fulfill the community badge goal-- I feel like I've layed off a bit of burden. I might want to revisit this comment some day, just like I want to revisit this game and be charmed again.  Also I'm aware of the impending multiplayer patch. Looking forward to it and hoping that the patch would bring an entirely new experience of playing an already splendid homage of a game.",1508052891,1508052891,1,76,2,0.837974488735199,0,1,0,0,0,

If you like farming, fighting, and flirting, but aren't too bothered with how deep any of these features go, this game is worth a go.  [UPDATE: The multiplayer, and follow-up updates made the game even more fun to play, and worth returning to! Updating from a 7/10 to a 9/10!]  The farming is the biggest lure for me. But when you reach mid-to-late game you will notice that the farm is mostly maintained by itself and you just have to worry about appeasing the locals (if you haven't maxed their affection already), fighting monsters (if you haven't gotten bored of it already), or tending to your livestock (if you even have any).  Made more interesting is that the end game becomes even more self-sufficient when you can start having the farm run itself completely, only needing you to plant seeds.  And the townsfolk do come with their own stories and character developments so there is always some NPCs you will end up liking. And being nice to them will see you rewarded as you go along. And I think they basically keep returning the favours as time goes by. However, once you max out an NPC (or marry them), that's where the interest stops. You had your fun, but now they are just doing their usual routines and talking to them no longer feels all that great since they repeat the same lines about how today is, or that you're a good buddy.  But, hey, more updates are coming, and I am certainly excited for them! :D Especially the long awaited multiplayer!  The game is a pleasant distraction. And it's also mod compatible. So I can definitely recommend this game if you need to kill some time, but don't want to get too enthralled by a story.",1498581983,1627928584,1,93,4,0.866488695144653,0,0,0,0,0,

In my opinion in the most farming games you are bored after maybe an hour or two. But in fact- Stardew Valley isn't boring! Not at all! But let's start at the beginning.  When I started to play this game for an hour or a lil bit more I got really bored to be honest. The problem was that I didn't know how this game works. I didn't know how to go fishing, farming- or better say I didnt know how I had to organize my farm that all would work - and this is very annoying. So I would add only one thing to that game: [i]a tutorial[/i]. It would be really helpful so that you know what your first steps should be. But of course.. I have to say there are some guides here on steam who can help you a little bit too, but I think it's better if the game would explain and show you all. ;) And after I learned about the important things in Stardew I had really fun to create my own farm. The big difference between Stardew Valley and other farming games is that you can do lots of other things than only to be on your farm. For example: You can do mining. You have in this game your ""own mine"". And its really cool in there because there are a lot of floors. ( It feels a little bit like in the old Pokékom Dungeon games :D) And every floor is getting harder then of course.. in that mine are monster you have to fight ;). Fishing makes very fun too. Something that I really like too is that you can interact with lots of NPC's. You can fall in love with one of them (or everybody? ^^) and get married.. and have your own family too... or maybe you are unfriendly as hell so that noone notice you and you will be forever alone.. it's your desicion :P. But yeah really- it's so cool that you can get really good friends with them. Also every day you talk to them they say different things etc., its really awesome! I could say a lot of other good things about that game like that you have a libary where you can donate artifacts you find in that game and get cool stuff for your farm. Or that you have different festivals per year etc. So what I really want to say is: Even you don't like farming games (like me either) you should really try this game! You will probably love it after a few hours like me! ^^ That's all..                          Enjoy your day!",1498429255,1616849729,1,386,22,0.884645521640778,6,0,0,0,0,

It is a true spiritual successor to a game I never played, called Harvest Moon.  First thing first... if you love Harvest Moon, please go buy this right now and dig in.  If not, hold on and hear me out, then go buy the game...    The game has you inheriting a farm and building a life for yourself on the farm.  You build relationships and explore in the new community that you are thrown into.  The core of the game is based around a daily cycle, everyday you have to decide what you are going to accomplish each and every day.  This come down to farming, fishing, exploring, mining, and shopping.  But the seasons put pressure on you to handle your farm correctly and time everything down to the day.  It gets to the point you want to just spend one more ""day"" of in game time playing... much like Civilization has the just one more turn phenomenon associated with it.  Overall, there is very little to be upset about in this game.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants a nice and relaxing game.

I've heard a lot of things about this game. A lot of extremely [i]positive[/i] things.  And I was doubtful. Was Stardew Valley [i]really[/i] that good? I was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didn't actually know what a good game was. And as insulting as it may sound, in my defense, uhhm....   Before buying the game I hadn't really seen what it looked like, or knew what it was about. I just knew that it was published by the same company, Chucklefish, that had developed Starbound. I had loved Starbound.. So I was playing completely spoiler free. Haven't watched any videos, no tips & tricks, just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head.  So I bought Stardew Valley, and had pretty high expectations. If a game received THAT much popularity, it should be seriously good, right?   [h1]WHAT STARDEW VALLEY IS[/h1]  Plop. Into the world of Stardew Valley.   You completely start from the bottom, trailing after a tragedy and responsibility that's struck. A farm, barely any money, and the mystery of a town left in your hands. Whew. That's really a lot when you think about it.    Boy, did I NOT know what I was getting myself into.   At first, I was mesmorized. Or maybe lost is a better word. The beginning's all new and immersive, and the middle... kind of leaves you stuck. But, this is because I was impatient with the game. I went in wanting to finish it asap. However, I realized this game is NOT simply for you to buy and finish. It's something else... entirely.  The thing with Stardew Valley, It's all about exploration and management. Discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing. Creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous well-formed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth, and I'm going to tell you right now... it's totally addicting.   I bought the game a few days ago, and literally have played it all day since. I've NEVER done that with a game before. I found myself as a kid in a candy shop, gaping at all the different flavors, and being able to savor them all. And now, in Year 3 of the game.. I still have a lot more to discover.    [h1]PLAYING[/h1]  Compared to others, I've only played around 130 hours of the game thus far. Buy Stardew Valley. You really won't regret it. This game is beautiful. The music is whimsically lifting, and the soundtrack is wonderful. It's a work of art. You will find yourself falling in love with the characters, and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people, and who changes everyone for the better. It's so relaxing, so addicting, and so much fun. I have played games for years, played games with far more hours than I have with Stardew Valley- and yet, I always turn to Stardew Valley first. Why? It's amazing. It offers something to everyone.  The game rewards for the hard-working. Stardew Valley is a game where you really have to manage things, yet, it allows you to explore the whole art of it. Work hard as you play the game, and there are sweet rewards. And I'm talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop.  Here's the thing: you can take two routes with Stardew Valley. You can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game, or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer, but with also missing the point that Stardew is a management farming game.  Or, you can successfully find the balance between both. But how?  Stardew Valley allows you to store multiple accounts, which is fantastic. I recommend exploring with your first account, and learning the ropes. You seriously won't know anything yet, and will be like ""OMFG"" when you figure out there's a way that makes things one hundred times easier. After that, create a second account, and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer. This is a game in which you learn from your mistakes.  And now... I'm left in a spot where I can successfully thrive, and only continue to grow.   [h1]THE PROS[/h1]  - Enchanting music that sings as you play  - A simple yet fun art design that you can't help but fall in love with  - Characters whom capture your heart  - A shambled town that begins to thrive  - Hidden secrets that you can't help but want to keep discovering  - Amazing challenges that leave you wanting more  - Brilliant originality, which is incredibly difficult to find  - A storyline that changes your perspective beautifully  - Lots of fun, and I mean [i]lots[/i].  - Mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive- however, I play without mods.  - IT FINALLY HAS MULTIPLAYER!   [h1]THE CONS[/h1]  - As I said, the game rewards you for hard work. But only for hard work. It can be a grueling process, but it is extremely profitable. Those who don't like putting effort into a game won't enjoy Stardew Valley as much as other games.  - Time. Stardew Valley takes a lot of time to play through. It's a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on.  - Repetitive. The game can be grueling. To reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will SERIOUSLY hate. But, in the end, it's definitely worth the labor.   [h1]PLACES TO IMPROVE[/h1]   - I wish there would be more characters. Once you go through the storyline with everyone, there's not much lore left.  - More secrets and new areas, of course!    [h1]WHY IT'S JUST STELLAR[/h1]   Stardew Valley offers a lot of things, and has changed the lives of many people. Perhaps in peace, wonder, open-mindedness, the game gives a lot. But I have one thing that's been bothering me for a long time... How in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game?  Even though it's a farming game, which is commonly found everywhere, it's original with its own spins. It's extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message that's been developed so well. Stardew Valley is a lot of fun and awe, and it really draws a blank in your mind.  Buy Stardew Valley. At first, it might seem mediocre... but keep playing. Trust me, the candies are still sweet. And they really only get sweeter.",1497158774,1526180959,1,29629,576,0.953924775123596,69,1,0,0,0,

From the little kiss you can give your spouse in the morning, to finding the Mayors underwear in a special someones home, or a little flying witch that could bring you gifts if you are lucky. As a person with very intense anxiety this game helps to calm me down and relax.   Soundtrack and Music - The soundtrack is very calming and peaceful. It's very comforting to listen to as you water crops or mine in the cave. There is always a different song for different events giving it a nice feel good vibe.   Art and Graphics - The game is so beautiful. The art is very adorable and indie. With each different season and each new event or festival you have more quests and more to explore and it all is so stunning.  Characters - The characters are so in depth. They all have a different back story to why they are who they are. They also are mostly kind and sweet once they get used to you and you get used to them.  This game is so much fun and it really goes in depth. This game is one that you can lose track of real time because of how enticing it is. Once you start to get the hang of it there is no putting it down. Then you discover mods which add more game time because they add more to explore.   Overall, the is very fun and beautiful. If you want a good quality and long lasting game this is the game for you.  Down side - There isn't much to say about this game that is bad, especially since mods help make it better. I would love to see working multiplayer to enjoy in game expierence with friends. One other thing is, there is not much of a tutorial for a new player it can be very confusing. It can be confusing on what to do, or how important birthdays are and such can be. But besides these small things the game is amazing.",1496723950,1496723950,1,1262,59,0.931171894073486,4,1,0,0,0,

Also, I am not a big fan of farming simulation games, despite enjoying Harvest Moon and other city/empire building sims and 4X games. Most farming sims seem to reach a point of feeling like another job if you wanted to truly succeed, needing to follow a maximized layout for efficiency. That being said, Stardew Valley truly captured my heart for several reasons. It starts very much like Harvest Moon in that you sort of inherit a farmhouse and some land and you have access to a neighboring town with it's citizens to interact with. You do your farming duties as expected and try to make money to build structures common for a farm, upgrade tools, and interact with the surrounding environment and it's inhabitants within a seemingly short day/night cycle. What sets it apart from my expectations was how balanced the overall experience feels. There are tasks you will always want to complete, short and long-term goals to strive for, variety of activities to persue each day with little pressure to complete them aside from that which the player puts on themselves. There are seasonal and weather-specific items and events to find/catch/interact with, but they aren't vital unless you want them to be. The sprites, color palete, music, ambience and overall charm of the game are just right. You can spend most of your time just farming, and going that maximized layout route for highest efficiency if you wanted, though it isn't important. You can spend more time fishing, which is a fairly enjoyable mini-game if you can get the hang of it. You can forage and explore a ""dungeon-style"" mining areas with an acceptable combat system. You can get married to any townsperson with the (single) status, male or female, and have a family. When a game like this puts multiple suitors to choose from to form a more serious relationship, it needs to give each a variety of personalities and quirks. There are stereotypes, but they have a deeper backstory and feel more relatable to a player of any age and not so generalized to make them seem like cookie cut-outs with expected reactions and desires. There are adult themes, but presented in a way that is acceptable and understandable to anyone.  Overall, it's a very solid game that is more than just a farming/family simulator, has excellent music, great time spent for enjoyment-per-dollar, plenty of goals to persue and achieve without seeming over-burdened or underwhelmed. Just enough feeling and charms without the need for feels. 1-word review: Balanced.",1495228137,1495228137,1,68,1,0.830924808979034,4,1,0,0,0,

Without realising Ive spent several hours taking care of my virtual farm and and for the first time in weeks I felt calm, happy even. Since then it has become my safe place I go to when I feel really down. In short, I really Recommend this game if youre looking for something relaxing. And if you know anyone who is going through hard times, show them this game, it might also help them.  tl;dr - 10/10 , great for anyone feeling depressed",1487198263,1487198263,1,355,15,0.923127591609955,13,1,1,0,0,

I will recommend this game to anyone without any doubt, and in this review, I will try to explain why this game should be played and enjoyed.  [url=http://i.imgur.com/RXCEznt.png)]My Progress[/url]  [b]1. Story[/b] Well the story is quite simple:  you are a hard-working person who is employed by a big corporate firm, but you are starting to get flooded with work. Your grandpa has recently died and left you a typed letter which you can open when you are most in need. You think this is the time and you open the letter, whereby your grandpa tells you that when a certain part of life comes you need a change in order to feel normal again. In this case he invites you to go to his farm in the valley which is now unattended.   [b]2. Gameplay[/b] The game offers a huge amount of gameplay mechanics which are very nicely implemented into the game. You have chiefly 6 gameplay mechanics: Farming, Fishing, Mining, Foraging, Combat and Seasons. In my opinion farming is the main focus of the game; you can plant crops, water, protect and harvest them. They are your main source of income. The variety of crops is huge, and since the game has 4 seasons, there are crops which only grow in particular season, while other crops can grow for consecutive seasons.  [url= http://i.imgur.com/PZ07187.png]Picture of the farm durring Autumn[/url]   [b]- Fishing[/b]  is quite hard depending on how much time you want to invest in it. Again affect the types of fish you can catch. Catching fish was my main priority in my first hours in the game and my main source of money. It’s quite hard to make money out of fishing, but I found out  how to later. You can find treasures while fishing so keep that in mind. [b]- Mining[/b]  is good for when you get bored of fishing or doing stuff on your farm. It’s very interesting and after couple of visits to the mines you will be planning how many levels you are going to do in 1 day. In the mines you are going to find all kind of items, like minerals, geodes [i](which can be opened by the local blacksmith)*, and stones which can be used in crafting other items.  There are quite a few types of monsters located in the mines. Depending on how deep you are in the mines, monsters differ in damage done to you and how long you need to attack them to defeat them.  [b]- Foraging[/b]  is focused on chopping down wood and harvesting wild fruits, and foraging items. Of course I’m not covering the other gameplay mechanics in detail because there’s really  A LOT. It’s like trying to explain how life works to someone from another planet and doesn’t know how planet Earth is like. There are more mechanics like cooking, crafting various items, the valley’s own social community, quest lines which are quite large in number, community center which needs to be rebuilt [i](by you)[/i], local museum which needs  new artifacts, books and minerals to be donated.  There is a ton of stuff to be done in the game. In order to become even remotely close of completing the game you need to invest a lot of hours into the game, which is nice.   [b]3. Character customization  and selecting farm type[/b] Before the game starts you need to [i]“create”[/i] your character by selecting a vast amount of characteristics: skin colour, type of clothes, colour of the clothes, facial hair [i](for males)[/i], hair type, etc. The game offers a lot of variety for your character - you can create a pretty normal character or a very strange looking one.   There are also a couple of farm types or layouts you need to choose from. Each has its own pros and cons. I went with the forest type which offers more wood but it limits the space of your farm where you can plant crops. I think there is a farm type which is very hardcore but I can’t speak from experience.  [b]4. Soundtrack[/b] The game has a spectacular soundtrack and I absolutely adore it. It’s more than 2 hours long which is quite long for an indie game. The music is always right on spot and gives you a relaxing feeling while playing. I always love when the game and the soundtrack are actually [i]“talking”[/i] to each other, and complement one another perfectly.  [b]5. Secrets [i](no spoilers)[/i].[/b] This game starts slow with you working at the farm but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. You will be amazed at how many things you can do and find in this game.  [url=http://i.imgur.com/p1cBnLZ.jpg)]Super rare secret event[/url]  [b]6. Stardew valley’s wiki page and Look up anything mod.[/b] Wiki page is your best friend in this game; it’s a life saver. It helped me so many times when looking for things I could never learn inside the game. I honestly don’t know how you are supposed to find anything without this wiki page. Now while I was play Stardew I had like 20+ tabs open on my browser and all of them were wiki pages and I was constantly alt tabbing. It was getting frustrating after 80+ hours of doing it. One day I looked at Stardew’s subreddit  and saw a guy sharing a similar experience with 20+ tabs open, and another dude sharing about a mod where you can do all the wiki related stuff without alt tabbing. Well the mod is awesome, you simply click F1 when you are hovering over something with your cursor and a window with info pops up. It’s very useful but some people are calling it a [i]“cheat”[/i], though I don’t think so. There are also mods for finding artifacts but then that’s really cheating.   [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541/?)]Link for the mod[/url]  [b]7. Collectables[/b] They are hard, really hard. You have a special section in your in-game menu dedicated to tracking your progress and seeing what have you collected so far. One tab for the general items [i](crops, foraged items, monster loot, crops and animal products)[/i] which shows you the types and quantities of crops you have sold. Another tab for fishing shows all types of fish in-game. A tab for minerals that can be obtained from opening geodes and breaking stones in the mines, or by unlocking treasures while fishing. One tab for Artifacts - they are probably the hardest part of the game, since they are kind of randomly generated. The grind for them is real. Final tab is for cooking, which shows every recipe you’ve cooked. Even if you somehow found a complete meal, you will need to actually cook it in order for it to pop up in the list. *********************************************************************************************************** [b]Sadly I've reach Steam's review maximum characters and I can't post the whole reveiw at once.

I've tested 477 items for 15741 times to 33 villagers, I've chopped tons of woods, I've smashed tons of stones, I've reset the game for hundreds of times, And I almost lost this guide because my hard disk corrupted. In case of another disaster, So I've to release this halfway works, Whatever I currently have.  I believe Wiki's info are slightly inaccurate. That's why I make my own data references. You can still refer to Wiki if some info is missing in this guide. This guide will be continuously updated when I have free time. I may be busy at life, but I'll try to push updates to this guide. As multiplayer mode rolling up soon, I will include that as well.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=812676599  [b]Long Review Version[/b] Once I played Harvest Moon: Back to Nature on PlayStation 1 and Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town in Gameboy Advance. Then I continued to play HM:FOMT in VisualBoy Advance in PC, GBA4iOS for iOS and GameBoid for Android. I went for plantations, mining, fishing, feeding animals, wooing all the cute girls. Unlimited fun hours.  ""Dude, which girl are you chasing?"" ""Elli."" ""Just pass your game cartridge to me for a day; I'll make her grow to red heart in no time!"" ""Then help me to get 999,999,999G for Vacation House!""  We swapped GBA game cartridges, grinding it all the time after school hours. That was my childhood memories.  It all began when a friend of mine told me about Stardew Valley which arrives into Steam Store. A game that packs most of Harvest Moon features, which I played back from ten years’ time. I went on checking at Steam Store. Apparently, it looks similar as Harvest Moon, but I doubt how fun it is. All the while, the only farming simulator I loved was Harvest Moon. None other than that. Thankfully, my friend borrowed his Steam Library to me. For the first two hours, I was surprised that finally, FINALLY... A real farming simulator on PC platform. We do no longer running on emulators.  So the first month, as usual, I cleared my land, planting Parsnips and then went hunting for extra berries and grasses. But alas, what I noticed inside was totally blew my mind. No grasses but with different loots and proper item names. Dandelion, Daffodil, Spring Onion, Leek, Grapes, Hazelnuts. And then, there's Bus Stop. An overhauled open town that doesn't vertically or horizontally aligned compared to old Harvest Moon. Quests. Fresh storylines. Tons of letters and goodies in my mailbox. Combat mode in Mines. And MINECARTS!  This Stardew Valley is a new fresh farming simulator. At first, I'm at lost, but since I'm an ex-Harvest Moon addict, I still can keep up with the crops. However, challenges turn in which you have to defend your crops from overgrown weeds or crow attacks. Something new, you can feel it. In my first run, I used to be a monopolist. Spent all my money on seeds and gained maximum profits. But then, the funny part I placed almost more than 20 scarecrows to protect my crops.  I've no idea how far a scarecrow range can cover, how to simultaneously plant and harvest crops, how to organise items and much more. In my thoughts, there might be Steam Guide that helps players to play better. It took me few minutes to load a whole guide with heavy images. Images are wonderful, but still a lack of some details. And much to my disappointment, lots of guides in Steam Community are heavily plagiarised with the assistance from Wiki.  Ten years ago, as far as I remembered, game guides for Wiki hardly existed (Or maybe there's one?). Remember how we used CC Cheat Codes, IGN Walkthroughs, GAMEFAQs.com, and many more old sites? Veteran players are very well-versed at this. Most guides are solely written in text format. The tradition of writing text guide is fading. No comprehensive Steam Guide for Stardew Valley community ever had done this.  I stopped my game in the middle of Winter, Year 1. Over the months, I compiled all items and complete gifting. Day by day, data by data is being added to my works. One day, my portable disk went corrupted and thankfully my only backup still resided in my local disk. Thus, I've made my final decision to post my works in GAMEFAQs.com and Steam Community as what you've seen right now.  I as a fan of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley would like to thank all of the public contributors who had spent years to compile and posted detailed online walkthroughs for everyone to enjoy HM games, and now we're moving on to Stardew Valley. I wanted to do the same extensive guide for Stardew Valley. Also not forget to thank all my close friends who had helped me to test and verify game data too. As I continue to compile the remaining data, your feedbacks are greatly appreciated.  Feels like I'm relieving back some good ol' memories. Soon I'll have my own printed Stardew Valley guidebook on my bookshelf for my collection. Maybe I’ll be playing this for another ten years.

Animal Crossing fans will also find enjoyment in decorating your house and filling up the museum, and Rune Factory fans will enjoy the mines and subsequent risk-to-reward gameplay they provide. In addition to all this, you do NOT have to make friends with your shitty neighbors just to get tools anymore which is probably the best feature of this game. You can basically be a hermit, never get married, and never talk to anyone and you will not miss out. You can even complete one of the two main stories (you can choose which one to complete) without any bullshit socializing like the HM games force on you. But, if you did want to get married, you can even have the option of marrying the same sex which no HM game to date has offered.  The one complaint I have so far is the way the game saves. Saving in games today should be a convenient and accessible feature, this isn't the 80s when batteries were some expensive commodity and games are a lot more involved than they used to be, but this game has a very rigid way of only saving your game between days and you basically have to go through an entire day before you can save again. When you're used to HM games both offering you a diary in your house to save mid-day or even getting the option to skip saving (comes in handy when trying to pray to RNGesus for rainy weather), this can be pretty jarring and I do not understand why the game is like this. All I can figure is the dev prioritized stopping people from cheating over offering better convenience and assurance to the majority of people wh don't, and that was a poor choice. This isn't a PVP game, that is the only time where making design choices solely to prevent people from cheating, even at the expense of legitimate play, is valid, and this being a single-player game basically begs the question ""Who cares?"" when someone wants to cheese it. It isn't like the AI has feelings.",1477870473,1480113489,1,155,11,0.881779134273529,15,1,0,0,0,

My job allows me to do so, haha.  This last version helps with a ""issue"" (personally, I don't care too much about this aspect, thus I wouldn't call this a issue) with the replayability. After the 80th hour, I felt that there was little to nothing to really do in the game anymore. I reached a point were the only thing at my horizon was to make my farm HUGE in profit, maybe f*ck my marriage by getting way too well with the others in town and finish some unfinished quests.  This is were the lack of replayability would bleed a little the potential of the game. There was no way to move your buildings once built in your farm. You would have to, in order to reorganize your farm - for aesthetics or to time optimization -, move everything (animals included, maybe sell them) to demolish the building in question, so you could rebuild it with your new and improved farming techniques. After the 3rd year, though, you would have to use your golden guts to do so - I hadn't courage, haha. It was going to be too complicated. By this time, some players would probably create a new save and start over. I tried, but missed my old farm before my 1st hour in the new save, with a new character, was completed. I decided to wait for the 1.1 update - it was on its way - with the sensation, though, that the game had already lived up for it's price, for the concept and idea of the game was beautifully thought and executed.  If the 1.1 update's fate were to never see the light of the day, I would already be satisfied. Maybe even dreaming with a Stardew Valley 2.  But it came!  I got back to the game and I'm happy to tell that this free update does much more for the game, the replayability, for the characters of the town and for your farm than most of the paid DLCs of most games nowadays does. This update actually makes the game looks way too much cheap, haha.  You can now reorganize easily your farm, do some new quests, expand the farm in new ways with new buildings and interact with some characters that previously to this update wasn't possible. Now, also, the game has different farm maps that totally represents the different ways to play and profit in Stardew Valley. This feature totally valorizes the replayability of the game, since selecting different farm maps in different saves will surely change completely how you play your farm.  At least: I would recommend this game even before the update. I played for almost 90 hours and was completely satisfied. But with the 1.1, this game is a must-have - specially if you miss good Harvest Moon games and have a crush on RPG.  Do not fear: your money will be valorized with this game. (And I don't even talked about the incoming co-op mode! Haha)  ---------Expanding a little about the incoming co-op mode  @Lappro, this is the result of your request (:  I was just thinking that it might be a good idea to wait for more information to come out before it, since I don't know exactly how it will work out. So this part of the review is more of a reflection of what the future could bring, haha.  There is already a way to play it co-op using MODs, but I haven't tried it yet. Saw some gameplays with it and, for me, the bugs would much rather damage my hype than satisfy it.  Making a long story short: The distributor Chuckle Fish is working on translation as well as the co-op mode, while the creator (Concerned Ape) is fully focused in creative content. He, alone, worked on this 1.11 update.  Maybe, taking in consideration the work so far invested, is safe to say that with the co-op mode will come as well some new content to deepen the multiplayer experience. I say this because, while I would love to play with my bride, I can see the game becoming too easy as well - since the simple possibility to share the tasks would nearly double your energy bar (meaning that you would do twice in a day what you normally would be able to). This taking in consideration only a 2 players co-op. If it allow more to join... Well, the logic is simple do apply here.  All this, though, would not, in any way, ruin the experience. Exploring the dungeons (to gather resources or fight some creatures to complete some quests) or expanding your farm with more people will surely be entertaining.  With the 1.11 update came somethings that can be used to create some hostility in your farm. A map and a ""spell"". I haven't tried it yet, but it makes enemy creatures come to your farm at night. I'll certainly try these new features with my bride (:  I will expand my review with these information and more once the devs give us some new updates towards the incoming mode (:  ---------Off Topic: Sorry for any typos, english is not my native language (:",1477094461,1477868050,1,161,11,0.83873438835144,6,1,0,0,0,

They got very grindy to say the least, or just boring. I think Stardew combines both very nicely, and adds some good old dungeon crawling to boot ( I hear Rune Factory also did this well, but I've never touched the series so I can't compare ).  I'll do my best to list the pros and cons as I saw them.  Pros:  - Music is very nice and fitting for the seasons. What adds to this too is the music isn't -constantly- droning on. The game breaks up the music with just moments of silence with ambient sounds. This really helps break up the monotony and keeps you from getting sick of the music too quickly. Other than that, its just rather nice.  - Time stops while paused. Not sure if this is a constant in farming simulators, but still a nice feature so you can leave it up and go afk.  - Exploration and dungeon crawling is rewarding. Not only do enemies drop good resources, but the mines contain a tremendous amount of ore. The further you go down, the more plentiful. Not to mention it will record every 5 floors you go down, so you don't have to restart from the beginning. ( Getting a reward every 10 floors is also a nice incentive )  - Plenty to do. Between the farming and dungeon crawling, there's goals to accomplish inside the Community Center. In the same fashion of the floors of the dungeon, you get rewarded for completing these tasks/packs. Some better than others, but most have been very worth it.  - Leveling up skills reaps nice skills. You can essentially build your farmer to be proficient or do better in certain aspects of the skill, netting you a lot more gold depending on how you plan on playing. Maybe you want foraged things to be worth more, or maybe you want to have a chance of picking up two every so often.  - Getting married is also kinda nice. I mean yeah same old Harvest Moon has bee doing that forever. But its nice your character can marry any other character that is single. Just keep shoving salads in their face and they'll be all yours ( they also help you out every so often ).  - Its very open-ended, no oustanding or time-constraining goals you need to accomplish or you fail. Which for someone like me who wanted to just have a nice wind-down game, this was great.  - There's also a butt-ton of references and easter eggs, if you like that stuff ( I sure do ).   Cons: ( I generally tried to take something positive from these though )  - Personally I found the penalty for running out of HP in the mines to be a tad steep. Lost about 1/3 of my items, 2500G and the memory of the previous 11 floors, so I had to do them all over again before being able to advance again. Overall it wasn't a big deal and I'm more careful now, but at the point I was in when it happened it was very detremental.  - Unless you really stay on top opf the rest of your farm, trees and debris are gonna multiply BIG TIME. The hole western side of my land was just a mess of these full grown trees from out fo nowhere ( it felt that way anyway, where'd they come from?! ).  - Character options ( really just shirt wise, since that's the major thing outside the hair ) felt a tad samey and just switched the color most of the time. Don't get me wrong there's over 100 options and I applaud that, just they didn't seem very different from each other.  - A lot of the bachelors and bachelorettes just came off to be... kinda really unappealing. Just their attitudes and personalities were hard to like in most cases. This is completely subjective though. But I found myself half the time just going ""Wow, you are a really intolerable person"".  - This game is gonna eat up a LOT of your free time. Or maybe that's a pro. Either way, beware!   Overall if you're itching to play a really good farming simulator, and have enjoyed games such as Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, I'd totally recommend giving this a go. I'd say its worth is price of $15. Even though there are not so great aspects of the game, I think the good parts greatly outweigh the bad. You can usually take something positive from the experience. Mostly the game is fun, and in the end that's what matters. If you can have fun with it, you're gonna enjoy it.",1475195203,1475195203,1,85,2,0.847139835357666,3,1,0,0,0,

A full-on Stardew Valley junkie has been born. Now playing SV so long after its extremely successful release and talking about it makes it seem like I’m preaching to the choir; I mean it is already one of the highest selling indie games released this year. So reading this review must be something akin to seeing people download Snapchat or create a Twitter account for their first time. Either way, I can’t just abscond from writing a review because I feel like a grandpa that recently discovered Reddit, so let’s get to it.   Stardew Valley is a farming and micro-management sim/RPG, much like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing. Inheriting a dilapidated farm after the MC’s grandfather passes away, you choose to start a new life in this cute, rural town oozing with charm. With no specific “end-game” per se, you are free to do anything, and almost anyone…, you want. What many, who don’t own this game, fail to realize is just how much there is to do in this game. Intensely meticulous and well-polished game design allows for the ability to truly create a new, virtual, second life in SV.  [h1]An Unbelievable Amount of Content[/h1]  Living in a seasonal world with day/night cycles and various weather patterns, life is woven into the game due to so much variance and attention to detail. NPCs and businesses have schedules/operating hours, festivals and story features are time/season-gated, crops require maintenance, and relationships that may lead to marriage and children can be forged. You are also free to enjoy a solitary or social lifestyle performing one of many available activities, such as: farming, fishing, mining, cooking, crafting, organizing, foraging, exploring, etc. A Community Center/Museum/Bulletin Boards, alongside a Quest system that slowly promotes progression, provide hub-like areas filled with tasks and objectives for you to undertake. Additional RPG aspects of SV include: skill levels (which increase based upon the amount of work put into each activity), upgradable equipment/weapons/tools, upgradable farm buildings, and mail!  Even though SV is set in a semi-rural area, it does not mean that there aren’t any peculiar activities or supernatural beings running around. Slime monsters, ghosts, and sprites fill up the 120 floor mine, a reclusive wizard keeps watch amidst his tower, and Junimos (forest spirits) help perform major repairs/create new access routes around town in return for fulfilling collectible requests. SV also incorporates beautiful pixel graphics and colorful art design, employing the use of strong primary colors and seasonal themes alongside immersive particle animations (lightning strikes, snow, falling leaves/flower petals, etc.). Stardew Valley is far cry from a boring or stereotypical Hick Town.   [h1]A Must Have Experience[/h1]  ConcernedApe, the one-man developer team, and Stardew Valley are shining examples of how developers and their games/game releases should be modeled after in this industry. The high-content, high-polish, and bug-less game/game release is something that is becoming rarer and rarer these days, and ConcernedApe’s love for his craft is blatantly transparent after spending 10 minutes in the game. I also remember that he was spending all day, every day, answering, [i]and solving[/i], individual bug reports and questions [b]all by himself - for a week[/b], during launch. He also didn’t even have Early Access support to rely on either.  Knowing how amazing SV is, along with the developer, I can easily recommend this game to anyone. There aren’t many games on the market that have such widespread and mainstream appeal, especially towards the non-gamer/casual crowd; however, Stardew Valley has so much content that even niche gamers should be able to find something to do and like.

You're probably like me and have hundreds of titles in your backlog, games you've never beaten, heck, games you've probably not even installed yet. If you buy Stardew Valley, they are going to stay there for a long time.  This game is charming in a way that is honestly hard to describe. On the surface, it looks like a game that could only be described as work. Starting from nothing, you toil away on your newly inherited farm and try to make an honest living. The feeling when you clear your first plot of land and start a tiny farm with 9 potatoes that you have to manually water each day when you first get up feels oddly satisfying. You start to get into a routine, each day, you wake up, you pet your cat/dog and you dilligently go out to your potatoes and make sure they get the love and care they need to grow up and become big and strong, eagerly awaiting the pay off of your labor.  Days go by, you meet the people of the town one by one and learn all of their stories and quirks. After a few days, you realize all of these other characters have their own lives they are going about too. You start to develop relationships with them and they start to feel like a community that is fun to interact with and slowly become a part of. It's another part of each in game day you start to look forward to.  But, we haven't forgotten about our lowly potato plot. The day has finally arrived! You pluck those nine potatoes out of the ground and proudly walk them into town to sell to the local merchant. He happily buys them from you and you notice that you now have a little more money than you originally started out with. This time you buy 9 more potatoes and 9 melon seeds. You run back to your farm, clear another plot of land and plunk your hard earned seeds into the ground.  This is how the game gets you. The slow trickle of progress. The thought of wonder about what waits around each next discovery and the slowly growing farm you personally develop in any way you see fit. If ever there was a game about farming that had the ""one more turn"" mentality instilled, this is it.  Pretty soon, you notice hours are going by and you've stopped playing all your other games here on Steam. Counter-Strike? Fall-Out 4?  Grand Theft Auto V? They all fall to the wayside so that you can spend more time on your ever growing farm in Stardew Valley.  This game will leave an indelible mark on you and your gaming time that you will remember long after you achieve and see everything there is to offer inside of it.  So, in closing, as I started by saying : Don't buy this game...unless you want to really have an amazing experience taking part in a world that you won't forget any time soon. It's truly a remarkable game that WILL take up as much of your free time as you will allow and I personally guarantee that you will enjoy every hour of it.",1472539536,1472539536,1,164,48,0.817808210849762,5,1,0,0,0,

Apart from some rare occasions when my family literally forces me to go outside to do some minor chores like taking out the trash, I hadn't left the house for 2 weeks. Until I found this game.  I came across this game by chance on a random research on Google and was imediately attracted by the pixel graphics (I've had a soft spot for pixel games ever since I first played Pokémon on my Game Boy Color). I wanted to play the game, but I finished my college degree a couple years ago and couldn't get a job since, so I don't have a lot of money to spend on games I may not like. So I got the pirated version (not even knowing it was a pirated copy, I only found out it was a Steam game a couple days later). And started reading articles on the game. Found the wiki, found the modders community. Started to mod my game to customize the graphics and add extra features. Found the farm layout planner and fooled around in it for a couple days.  And I just fell in love with the game and the community behind it. The quality of the graphics, the amount of different features it offers, the support you get if you run into any kind of trouble. The game is so simple, yet so complex and detailed at the same time, it's so fun to play that it gets addictive. But it's also very relaxing to know you can just play at your own pace and take your time to explore and you won't be missing on any time-limit events. It put a smile in my face again.  I knew I just had to have a legit copy of this game, it felt like money well spent. So today I finally found a reason to wilingly get out of the house to ""go for a walk"" and have an excuse to charge my paysafe account and purchase myself the Steam version of this game. No regrets.  Also, the author is still working on the game, releasing regular updates with extra content years after publishing.

The things that make the game excellent is you can do whatever you want at your own pace, its a very relaxing game in my opinion, But if you want a more combative game you can head into the forest or the mines! Another thing I liked about the game is you can fit yourself into the town, you can chat and gain relationship points every day and end up settling down and having kids! Everybody has there own story with this game you can choose from many characters to marry or become friends with you can explore the mysteries of the town hall and the mines, or you can have a peaceful life planning out your farm's layout upgrading your house and buying animals to take care of. Also, the game is a lot like Harvest moon, but at the same time not. I would play this game over harvest moon any day! But it still has the shipping box the foraging mechanic and relationship bar! Another thing I liked is the customization! you can pick from 100+ shirts hair accessories and more you can choose your preference of dogs or cats (If you play the game you know why they do that ;)) And More! Btw The creator Makes many updates improving the game! Also would still recommend after beta release play with friends a lot!

Story/Characters: While not heavily driven by the story, Stardew Valley sets up your farm-life, and fills it, with many solid, and fun cutscenes. You'll also run into a few nuggets of lore occasionally. Every villager in Stardew Valley is unique, and worth getting to know.  9/10  Gameplay: The farming life has never been better. I fell in love with farming, then with fishing, then with mining. All these are valid methods of keeping a steady income in Stardew Valley. So, I had fun devoting days to different activities, while also completing different quests and requests from the villagers. Also, there are mods, which I haven't even gotten into yet. 9.5/10  Sound: Relaxing, colorful, and happy music kept me humming while doing my daily work. The sound effects were also bright, and they fit in perfectly 9/10  Replay Value: I played Stardew Valley for 45+ hours. In that time, I completed 1.5 ""years"", got married, earned quite a lot of items and money, and [i]almost[/i] finished the community center. That might satisfy most; I plan to do it all again, with a few mods. 8/10  Overall Score: 8.9  Summary: Personally, I had a ton of fun with Stardew Valley, and will never forget this game. Thanks to ConcernedApe for this awesome game. I love the crap out of it. Everyone should at least try it.

Since this review will contain minor spoilers, stop reading now, just buy the game, even at the full price, and spend the next dozens of hours in Stardew Valley!  This review is based on an incomplete experience, I did not even get to the first winter yet. I have only 30 hours in the game, as I write this, and that is nothing. Still, after almost three months after the release, it is time to make this review. And yet, this is not an ordinary review, it is more like a love letter.  Stardew Valley is a farm simulator. Calling it a Harvest Moon clone, however, would be like calling Quake a Wolfenstein 3D clone. The game takes elements from Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, mixes them all together, and presents us with a small world to explore that holds its mysteries.  The story is simple at first: You work for Joja, a huge company, and get tired of your life there. So you move to a farm that once belonged to your grandfather. You arrive there with a character you created yourself - boy or girl - and start your new life. You meet the townspeople, start seeding and watering your first crops, and soon notice that Joja also has a business in town. Your first real conflict comes from the Community Center. Will you help rebuilding it to its former glory, or will you assist Joja in expanding their company? After a few days, you discover that an old mine has opened, and you can start mining ores to improve your farm tools. Eventually you can build more farm buildings and work with animals or even slimes. You can fish, you can forage, and you meet more people, unlock a few more places to visit eventually. You can even fight and sell monster remains, or use them to craft things.  Gameplay: Well, the gameplay follows very much the Rune Factory formula. The controls are fine, but you should enable the option that makes you see what field your tools will work on. Like in Rune Factory etc. you run around and can converse or use tools with a simple click. As said above, there are many things to do - would you rather grow crops, forage shells, fish or mine? Or all together? In each profession you level up and unlock new blueprints that you can craft, including better sprinklers, so you will want to specialize in everything sooner or later. But the progress often comes naturally, just as you play. And then you have the mysteries to unravel: What are the mysterious creatures in the community center? What does the wizard know? Where are the mayor's pants? Umm, okay, I solved the latter one, but let us just not talk about it. Anyway, the quests, awkwars as they might be, often help giving personality to the characters, of which you also have 10 marriage candidates. And yes, you DO have the homosexual options. Although, to my (hetero male) taste, there is maybe only one or two male candidates out of the five possible ones, that are appealing at all. As for the women, the ones I would love are not relationship options... here's looking at you, Robin.  One word of warning, though (as I said, minor spoilers): It is possible to lose animals to wolves or something. As there is no option to make manual saves, this was a gamebreaker for one of my friends who could not find the heart afterwards to go on anymore, and instead played other games again.  Music: The music is great, it really fits the game.  Graphics: The graphics are held in a style that reminds of console games, but run absolutely smooth. The world has a distinctive yet familiar look, it feels like a 1990s SNES RPG. I mean, just look at the screenshots at the store page.  Recommended: Yes! Even at full price! In fact the game is so good, I even bought another copy at full price to gift it to a friend!  Oh, and did I mention that this masterpiece was made by one guy alone? That's right, ConcernedApe, as he likes to be called, has created the graphics, music, game code and everything else alone! Kudos!  Now stop reading and start playing the game!  EDIT, 7 October 2016: ConcernedApe added several new farm layouts, so now there is even a strategical choice to be made at the beginning of the game, giving you more potential to follow the profession you prefer: Mining, Fishing, Foraging, even fighting. The mulriplayer coop mode supposedly will come in 2017. Also the game is in the next Humble Monthly Bundle, so there is no reason to not get it right now!",1464077329,1475866106,1,124,8,0.838036835193634,2,1,0,0,0,

Would you ever want to?  For reasons that are hard to explain, this is one of the best games I've ever played.[/h1]  This title is about nothing except escapism.  You will trade your life, ideally on a temporary basis, for the life of your self-designed character in Stardew Valley.  In the game, you escape your boring cubicle job to live a simpler life as a farmer in a close community that is struggling to stay relevant in an increasingly conglomerate-dominated western society.  The game manages to argue an anti-corporate-America ""Wal-Mart is bad, but not inherently evil"" agenda in such a real way that is impossible to ignore; all the while providing you the opportunity to choose for yourself; and unabashedly encouraging you to embrace capitalism to maximize the value of your labor and intellect.  The game succeeds in this alternative reality in much the same way The Sims captured so many gamers' hearts.  In Stardew it seems you are able to achieve things that perhaps you cannot achieve in real life.  However, you will leave the game feeling happy, uplifted, and hopeful.  Beneath this existentialism is a day-to-day deluge of strangely addicting activities.  Mine, farm, make friends, help the community, cook, craft equipment, manage your finances, fish (oh how I love to fish), forage, ranch, etc, etc....  By providing more structure, than say Minecraft's survival mode, the game succeeds in guiding us something much more fulfilling.  The aesthetic, think of it as an improved 16-bit Legend of Zelda, you will soak it in.  It is my phone's background.  You will learn to love the bright colors and simple sprites while despising the grittiness of real life.  The music, it's so simple it should drive you mad, but it's so happy it will soothe your soul.  Reading discussions, you will hear of gamers who are self-treating their anxiety, depression, mental illnesses.  There is something very special about this game.  There is something very important about this game.  It will brighten your days and provide you with a measure of joy.

The game was developed by ConcernedApe, and published by Chucklefish Games.   Stardew Valley is heavily influenced by the Harvest Moon series. At the start of the game, you are left a plot of land by your grandfather. When you arrive at this land, you will find it overrun with weeds, trees and rocks. Your aim is to clear this area and restart a farm that will make you money. There is a heavy focus on character interaction too. Allowing you to converse with plenty of NPCs around the town and develop relationships which can sometimes result in marriage. This has benefits to your farm as the NPC will also help out around the plot too.  As you grow your farm day by day, you will unlock new ways to generate money, whether it is from simply growing crops in the fields, selling fish, or your livestock. The game also has a questing system which will also generate extra revenue for you as well.   The game’s day night circle is really a key feature in the game too. You will soon realize that there are just not enough hours in the day to get everything done. Not only are you battling against time, but you are also up against an energy meter too. I wasn’t that keen on the energy meter because literally everything you do burns the meter down fairly quickly. When you start out the game and are just clearing away weeks, you will perhaps get 5 minutes’ worth of clearing done before your character is out of energy and has to go to bed in order to regain it. You can regain your energy in other ways but the conventional way is just to head to bed and wait until the next morning.  The game’s fishing system is also a little cumbersome too, it’s a small mini game when you head out to the waters to catch some fish; I personally found this a little too unforgiving but some may find the difficulty on the fishing feature to be a nice addition rather than just pointing and clicking.    Normally I am not a fan of this style of graphics, but Stardew Valley has just the right amount of character to make this work for me. The game’s vibrant colours and beautiful sprites just make everything click together. It really does remind you of the Harvest Moon series of games, but has its own unique charm to go along with it.  The sound track for this game is also exquisite too, so much so that you can purchase the sound track individually too. The game’s ambiance sounds are wonderful too. This is one of the few games where I think not having voice acting worked in its favour, because if it had been done wrong, it could of spoilt the whole game for me.    This isn’t a hard game as such; it is just a time management game, and a waiting game for the majority of the time. You can get yourself in a situation where your farm will almost fail like I did; spending all my money on seeds, planting them, and then a storm coming over night and ruining them all, resulting in me not having enough money to buy more seeds. That is the hardest moment I have found in the game, building you up again after a really big knock back. But if you are happy to put the work in, you will succeed with flying colours in this game.   I have been playing Stardew for a little under 20 hours so far. I have been primarily focusing on building up my farm and growing my empire; I have yet to touch many of the quests and NPC interactions with plenty of content still to see, I anticipate at least another 15 hours or so before I grow (no pun intended) of this game. What I am most excited about is the possibility of a four player co-op mode being released. This will make the game an absolutely epic experience in my opinion.   Technically, as expected the game runs perfectly fine, with 60 FPs 100% of the time. The game has full controller support, but I found playing with keyboard/mouse to be better in this instance. There is a fairly comprehensible menu with lots of options to change should you choose.  I will give the devs props here; they are a very active community member with plenty of hotfixes being released, not to mention the mod scene is increasingly becoming more and more popular with this game.   Stardew Valley is a game that you will either love or hate. If you go into this game expecting plenty of action and fast paced game play, you will be disappointed. If you want a peaceful, slow paced experience, then you will definitely want this game in your library.  There were times that I was sometimes just playing mindlessly and the thought of “am I actually having fun here?” kept popping into my head, and sometimes the answer was no, to which I quit the game, but low and behold, 10 minutes later I felt my self-compelled to load it up again just to farm that one last batch of crops I have growing. It is a very additive game that kept me coming back for more and more every time.  At the moment I am going to highly recommend Stardew Valley; if the devs follow through on the multiplayer addition, that will quite possibly tip it towards the must play side of the scale.

As someone who has been immersed with the gameplay for almost a week now, the only thing that I could say is to bid farewell to your personal life and have fun.   [h1][u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u][/h1]  The game starts off with you talking to your grandfather and him handing over a letter that will give you the chance to change your lifestyle in the future if you ever so desire. Years later on, you are living in the city and working as an employee of a grand corporation named ""Joja Corporation"", but feeling empty inside. That was then when you remembered what your grandfather left you and took the chance to start a new life with nature.  [b]Welcome to Stardew Valley![/b]  In this game, you play as a village farmer who inherited the land from your grandfather. After the introduction, you will also start with the basic version of tools that you need for growing and maintaining your farm (which can be upgraded with the required items and money through the town's blacksmith) and some cash to purchase the things you need (which is basically money to buy seeds).  Each season will cycle on a 28-day basis, which also has you limited on the crops that you can sow and harvest (aside when growing them inside the greenhouse). Weather also changes depending on the prediction from the forecast which will help you on planning the tasks you need to do as the game progresses.  Aside from the farm, you can also interact with the other villagers (NPCs) by either helping them out from a certain request or by giving them gifts, which will help you in befriending them or even be intimate (only for those who have the [single] word below their icon on your list) if your relationship level is high enough.   But not only that! You can also fish, mine ores, find and donate artifacts, raise farm animals, turn your crops or goods into products, forage fruits and flowers, or even explore dangerous caverns and mines and become a true adventurer!     [h1][u][b]The Pros[/b][/u][/h1]  [list] [*][b]Tons of Content[/b] - There are tons of things to work on this game aside from farming. May it be socializing with other people, fishing, excavating and exploring the mines, etc. This attribute pretty much sums up most of the great things this game as to offer, which also contributes to the second factor.   [*][b]Immersive Gameplay[/b] - I am not really certain which feature is the most prominent factor that makes this game addicting, but I am confident to declare that each and every single one of them works in harmony to bring out the best for its players.   [*][b]Great Audio[/b] - The soundtracks made for this game really fits the theme of each and every scenario it has to offer. Not only the soundtracks but also the ambience effects really make up the feel as a whole. The sound of the animals, the rustling of the plants, and flow of the water are just some to enumerate. [/list]   [h1][u][b]The Cons[/b][/u][/h1]  [list]  [*][b]Minor Bugs and Game Errors[/b] - Though it might not be game-breaking, the game still has a fair amount of bugs and errors that could be a point to improve on. Some of the bugs that I have encountered are showcased on my screenshots so feel free to check it when you have the time.   [*][b]Too Immersive Gameplay[/b] - You might think that this portion is a joke, but I am dead serious about this. For someone who works on a daily basis, I really don't have the leisure of playing games like before when I was still studying. I already spent my leaves for this month and cancelled a few meetings with friends and colleagues, and I am expecting worse to come. This game WILL take your TIME and if you don't have the WILL to sacrifice it, then at least stay away until you have some kind of long vacation.  [*][b]Repetitiveness[/b] - This is most likely the nemesis of every simulation game. After every year, there will be small additions to the cycle of the game to make it fresh as long as possible, but it is still inevitable that you will reach a stage where you can say that you have played enough.  [/list]   [h1][u][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/u][/h1]  Well, I'll just save you the time and get straight to the point. If you ever had that one bit of interest when you saw this game, [b]DO NOT HESITATE AND GET IT[/b].

This game is honestly the best game I have played in years, like I can't express how much this game is so heartwarming, loving, feels amazing, fun, replayable and the list of adjectives that I could use range on and on and on and on. This game is literally the best game I've played in ages, and if you don't do yourself the pleasure of playing it; at LEAST watch videos on it because this game deserves the most attention and most amount of love towards it!  Starting off with the story, you are an office worker who works for the ""Joja Corporation,"" sitting in front of your PC and rotting away along with the life around you. The amount of people you see in the starting intro who are wasting their lives away is honestly quite depressing and doesn't even match the tone for the game at all. This game uses the form of a ""Tonal Shift"" which basically starts the game off with such a dark tone, but enlightens it when you get to your bright, vibrant and amazingly joyus farm. The story of the game is that your grandfather gives you an envelope to only open when you need a break from your rural life. Thus the game begins.  You are introduced to your farm by the lovely Robin. She tells you that the farm looks kinda trashy and laughs at you. She may seem like an evil girl now, but she turns out to be such a lovely girl. Now, whilst I'm talking about the people I think it is a good idea to talk about the townsfolk. I honestly feel such a bond and an actual care between all the villagers and all the people that you encounter. They all seem unique and some of them seem to have such a troubled past and many have dark secrets which may be discovered as you progress through the game.  This is yet another amazing example of how the game makes you feel like you fit in and bond. You talk to the villagers and have the option to gift them 2 gifts per week, the villager may love it or they may despise it, and will make it quite apparent if they hate it. As you go up the heart scale, you will unlock cutscenes between the villagers and they may send you meal recipes in the mail. Me, myself, I have never fit in well with people. I would be the person in school (and I still am) the person who would get left behind or be forced to walk behind the person in front. Jist of the story, I was never popular. You're probably wondering where I'm going with this; and well, this game has made me feel like I fit in and that I am actually part of a community of people that care about me. It's a heartwarming feeling and makes me feel so happy and just makes me feel a feeling that I've never felt in a video game.  Enough of the sappy stuff, let's talk about the basicness of this game. Yes, the basics. I know the basics of some games may be quite boring but this game just does it. This game starts you off with tools and just lets you live off the land and allows you to remove the trees, rocks and other forageable items which may be lying around your farm. This game is literally your big, fat sandbox and it allows you to do whatever the hell you want to do with it! The game makes me feel like I am free and that the game isn't restraining me to doing anything and isn't stopping me from doing anything. Stardew Valley does an amazing job of letting you feel like this is YOUR house so YOU can do what YOU want. This game is all about you and making you feel like it's your farm and you can do it. I may be sounding repetitive, but I need to enforce that this game is your oyster.  So, you've probably heard that this game is like a cross between ""Harvest Moon"" and ""Animal Crossing,"" and it really is. This may sound like it's a bad thing, but if you've played either of those games you'll realise that those games are extremely good and make you feel like you're free and have the ability to do anything. Planting your crops (will get into this soon!) is extremely relaxing and is just such a great time waster. Everything in this game just feels so amazing and is just, I'm at a loss for words without repeating myself.  Onto what it's like to actually plant the crops. Planting crops is a great way of making money in Stardew Valley, be if for your own personal use or be it for money. You use your hoe on the ground to till the land, you then place some sort of seed into the tilled land and then water it. Proceed to water it every morning and soon you will have an amazing, bountiful farm filled with delightful looking crops and more colours than the eyes can make out. You don't have to farm in the game, unless you want to actually follow the basic premise of the game, duh. But there are other alternatives which I cannot for the life of me remember right now.  So, there's fishing in this game. Are you surprised? Does the word fishing strike fear into your veins due to other games having such dastardly and terrible fishing minigames? Well, release your fear. The fishing minigame in this game is actually bloody brilliant. The fishing minigame is where you control a green bar and keep it on the fish. If you keep it on the fish for a certain amount of time, congrats, you've caught you're first fish (and probably not your last!) If you manage to not keep the green bar off the fish, the bar will decrease and will soon stop the fishing. That is about it. Oh, also, you have a chance to catch a treasure chest which can contain something really good or something, well, something. You can also build ""Crab Pots"" which can capture unique types of fish (and trash!)  There's so much in this game that I need to talk about, so I hope you're sitting comfortably and are ready for this to go on and on and on. Onto energy and how that works. Energy is vital in this game, and can sometimes be such a crippling factor in this game. You require energy for literally everything you do. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but I'm saying that you need to make sure that you can manage your energy and ensure that you don't overdo it. Overdoing it will exhaust you and you'll have to go to sleep; if you don't sleep you will fall asleep and someone will leave you into your house. You'll wake up the next day with a letter in the mail telling you that they found you out cold and left you back home.  The game allows you to experience it at your own pace. If you want to play slow and take each day as it comes, do it. You're allowed. You want to play the game fast and wild? Do it, you're allowed. You want to just play the game and not worry about how or what will happen? Do it, you're allowed. At the end of the day, as I've said before, you can do whatever the hell you want and you are free to do what you want. You are literally the owner of this game and you can do whatever the hell you want. This game is about expressing yourself and letting you be the controller of the game.  Stardew Valley has a museum system which allows you to donate your found artifacts and other little gems that you find throughout the game. Finding these things will allow you to get rewards which can decorate your house or unlock a whole new place to visit (OoOOoOoO foreshadowing!) This game rewards you for playing it. It rewards you for being you. It also rewards you in so many ways and just lets you be you. You can also find ""Geodes"" in the land which the Blacksmith may open up for you for the small price of 25 gold! Within these, you can find things to donate to the museum, or if you want to take the monitary approach to it you can sell the things you get from the Geodes.  Final words (I ran over the word limit!!!) I adore this game. I adore ConcernedApe. I adore this game and this community. This game is actually turning out to be the best game that I've ever played and I can't wait to sink many, many, many more hours into this truely magnificent piece of art.  Perfect. 10/10.

Too many reviews say ""this is like Harvest Moon"", ""oh it's so cute like Harvest Moon"" and ""it's a wondeful remake of Harvest Moon"". That's not very helpful. I never played Harvest Moon. I never heard of Harvest Moon (unti this game came along). I was playing computer games when it came out but the SNES was never my cup 'o tea. If you're like me, this is the review for you.  Without knowing what Harvest Moon is, I'm coming into Stardew Valley with a fresh set of eyes. And what these eyes have beheld is pretty magical. The one word I'd use to describe Stardew Valley is enchanting. The game play revolves around building up your farm, fighting / mining in the mines, fishing and bribing the townspeople to like you. It frankly doesn't sound like much but it's much more than the sum of its parts.   First of all, the farming is deep and entertaining. There are many crops to sow, groves to plant, animals, sap and a host of artisan-type improvements to your basic ingredients. There's simply so much to do here it's tough to see it all. And if you're creative, you can construct some beautiful farms so they are visually pleasing along with productive. It's not easy though - you need to slowly clear your farm, build up your money for seeds and you'll need raw ingredients from elsewhere (mainly mining) to truly become productive and self-sustaining.  Other areas are simple but rewarding. Mining doesn't sound like fun, but each level of the mines brings new challenges and rewards. Fishing can be challenging and even frustrating but as your character levels that skill you'll find you're able to haul in even the most challenging catches. It doesn't seem like the Valley is very large but as you complete challenges in the Community Center new areas will open up, each with it's own unique style and bonuses. You'll forage through the landscape and acquire more resources that way.  The townspeople deserve their own mention. They seem like they're the standard tropes - the jock, the vain girl, etc. - but as you get to know them you'll find they're unique characters and somewhat memorable. The villagers have their own schedules and you'll have to work around those schedules to get what you want.   As for downsides, probably the most annoying thing is this ""bribe people to be my friends"" aspect. I'm not a fan of the limitations and I'm not a fan of the message that sends. But that's a minor problem with what is just a great, fun, relaxing and entertaining game. I'd recommend this game for people from 8 to 80 (I'm on the older side of that scale). It's simply a wonderful product.",1458399770,1458407888,1,185,22,0.833122074604034,0,1,0,0,0,

A formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell.   But there is something Stardew Valley has over Harvest Moon, and that's a heart. The intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable. I sympathized with my character right off the bat. I think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind, and in a funny kind of way, this game does that.   A moment I felt that the game truly had a soul was when I was walking to the mines on a rainy day, when suddenly I was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon Abigail, my romance interest, playing a flute next to the lake. It's a very quiet scene, with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing. After some dialog, my character (who is a silent protagonist by the way) pulls out a mini harp and joins Abby in a duet, something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene. It was a bonding experience, and it felt incredibly real, memorable, and touching. I'll always remember it.   And when you realize that there are TEN love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them, man, that's an intimidating amount of content.   Maybe I shouldn't be saying that Harvest Moon doesn't have any heart at all, but when it comes down to it, this is the game that I'm going to remember more fondly in the end. I made memories with Harvest Moon as a child. Now I'm making memories with Stardew Valley as an adult. You should too.

Your farm can be whatever you make it, You design what it looks like, how it runs, what you plant and what animals you choose to raise. The fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it. On days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems, ores and minerals, Some that you can donate to the game's huge museum or use to upgrade your tools!   I can't praise this game enough, if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale, Don't wait!

This game gets compared a lot to the Harvest Moon series which I have never personally played. Couple that with the fact that I have also never played a farming sim before and this is pretty much as pure of an opinion on the game itself as you can possibly get.  Now to the point. Stardew Valley is incredibly fun and has managed to hold my interest so much that I'm playing as much as I can lately. There is a bit of a learning curve if you are not familiar with anything from the Harvest Moon series. Friends I know who have played that series and then Stardew Valley clued me into a lot of little things I didn't know about and likely wouldn't have figured out until I read about it somewhere later. But what makes this game even more impressive to me is how a single dev took so much inspiration from something he clearly loved, mixed in loads of player feedback, and built something truely special. I wish I had been one of the people that learned about this game early on so I could have watched it grow (no pun intended).  I also can't help but love the retro art style of classic RPGs, yet with the modern polish and bright colors that make it stand out as still being something new. I can't help but wonder if Chucklefish helped Concerned Ape out with some of that considering how much it reminds me of the art style used in their game Starbound. But either way it's got a surprisingly good level of detail to it with lots of character. As far as how the game plays, I found myself loving the simple yet challenging approach of levelling your five core skills and learning the best techniques to maximize the efficiency and profits of your farm. You start off struggling to make everything work in that first year and by your second you really start to feel like you know what to do now.  The story is also simple but with a lot of charm. Even though Pelican Town is small it always feels like there is something new to discover about the people who live there. While it can take a lot of time and effort to befriend everyone it becomes worth it to see how they all interact together and how much of an impact your character can make in their lives. It's the ultimate expression of a lively small-town community and looking out for your fellow man. Something I think a lot of us lose sight of sometimes in this digital age. But let's not forget the symbol of modern change that takes form in Joja Corporation, a megacorporation looking to monopolize Pelican Town. You can either decide to help them out (for a price) and increase the town's reliance on Joja Corp, or instead work to restore the town's community center and promote local business and interaction, declining Joja further business opportunity in the area. It's a powerful underlying message to the whole game and something many can feel passionate about one way or the other.  Lastly I need to mention the price. For all the hours I've sunk into this game already and will likely continue to add in the future, the $15 price tag feels like a steal. I can't help but highly recommend this game at full price because if you are a fan of this type of sandbox RPG farming sim you will easily justify the cost twice over. I actually bought the game for a friend because it was affordable and something I could recommend to anyone and I knew my friend would enjoy it. While I'm sure it's bound to end up on sale when the initial hype dies down, please don't be someone that waits specifically for that to happen. This game is worth every cent and doesn't cost any more than a month of game time for any MMO out there. If you are sincerely interested and have the money, don't wait.  TL;DR: This game is freaking amazing and you should get it.",1457691257,1457691408,1,187,16,0.903186023235321,7,1,0,0,0,

It's a Harvest Moon-like where you move out of the city and into a cabin. From almost nothing, you can slowly build up a giant farm, but that's not all there is to do. You can also forage, fish, make friends in town, or explore the monster infested mine.  I don't think I've ever before seen an indie game where all of the sound, art, writing, and gameplay elements work together so perfectly.

You start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables. The game is simple in its understanding: build a farm, make profits, live your life. What the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered. You're left with the freedom to explore the town, its residence, mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time. Sure, there are events to attend, festivals to see, men/women to romance and marry, kids to have, buildings to construct, fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay (Dragon Warrior, anyone?), but how and when you do those things is up to you.   In essence, the game offers you very similar things to do as a Harvest Moon game does: Build and upgrade your farm, plant crops, upgrade tools, mine in the never-ending dungeon for precious ore, go fishing, romance and get married...etc. While some of your old favorites are back, new aspects have been introduced as well, but I won't spoil those in this review. Let's just say there's a nice story that evolves over time.  The freedom to do as you please is what makes this game, and Harvest Moon in general, so enjoyable. It's a chance to mellow out, play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer. What Stardew Valley does, it does right. It's charming, cute and feels rewarding, even when all you're doing is cuttings weeds. It doesn't pull any punches or try to be something its not; the developer had a goal in mind and Stardew Valley is a reflection of just that. You can feel the effort, the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years. Stardew Valley is a gem and worth looking at. If you loved Harvest Moon, you'll love Stardew Valley.  To date, Stardew Valley is a single player game, though the developer as mentioned some form of co-op or multiplayer availability in the future.   [h1] Pros [/h1]   [list] [*] Character Customization - Always good, always wanted.  [*] Visuals - In the style of the SNES. They're colorful detailed and a delight. [*] Game Pace - Fast, slow, or somewhere in the middle. It's your call to make. [*] Content - There is a lot more to do than I first imagined. There are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline.  [/list]  [h1] Cons [/h1]   [list]  [*] Combat - It's a tad basic since that isn't the core of the gameplay. A single hack/n slash mechanic [*] Citizens - I'd love to see more citizens (even temporary ones during the year) come and go to make the town feel more ""alive"" [/list]   Overall, Stardew Valley is a pleasure. I haven't put a ton of time into it (yet), but I easily see that happening. It's fun, lighthearted and addictive. As I said earlier in this review, if you've ever played Harvest Moon, you'll enjoy Stardew Valley. It's worth checking out and I highly recommend it. This will easily become one of my most played games on my list. You won't be disappointed, so check it out!",1457471343,1459882231,1,937,45,0.946065664291382,20,1,0,0,0,

The art and pixel style threw me for a loop, and while I loved Harvest Moon style games and Rune Factory 4, I wasn't too sure about spending money on this game. I've been burned before and I was wary of trying it. It was about... I think a day of or after the release and I noticed it had a small sale and I figured, ""Well, I just got paid, and it might be a good distraction until I find another game to play.""  ...So, uhm. You might have noticed I have 71 hours of playtime. So I figured I'd better write my thoughts on why I love this game.  Music: 10/10 Everyone knows that what helps make a game great is the music it has. I was immediatly sucked in by the music, it reminded me so much of the Harvest Moon games I played that had such amazing music! If there was a soundtrack available (maybe there is) I would be willing to drop money on it.  Controls: 7/10 The controls of the game are not the worse I've encountered, but I feel it could be improved a bit. Honestly, if I hadn't found the control options this would have had a 5/10 review instead. The 'show tool hit location' was not automatically selected so it led to some frustrating moments just trying to till the ground. The combat was a bit frustrating since you had to turn your character in order to swing the sword in the exact direction it has to go in, but after some practice I've ironed out the kinks.  Storyline: 12/10 Oh my god guys. This, this right here helps make the game for me. Its honestly what I have been sorely missing in other farming games like Harvest Moon. Its not just ""till the land, plant the seeds, make the cash."" No, this is much more then that. I would love to go into detail, but I don't want to give anything away to people who want to come in blind.  Characters: 10/10  These loveable characters have their own flushed out hopes, fears, and dreams. They have their strengths, their weaknesses, and their own personality. Not one character is the same, their life experiences make them what they are and their background helped shaped them. But at the same time they grow, they adapt, they change. The more you interact with them the more impact you have on their lives. Its amazing.  Character Customization: 10/10 What many Harvest Moon games lacked until recently was being able to customize your farmer. However Stardew has by far the best I have seen. Around 30 different hair styles, over 100 different shirts to chose from, skin color, eye color and hair color. You want to make yourself look like the hulk? Get your green on and hulk up for some farming! Want to be a vampire? A demon? You can be anything!  I would add more but honestly I am a little under the weather as I'm writing this and I'm rapidly running out of energy. So a last few tid-bits for you guys and gals considering this game.  This game does not end in an XX amount of years. You can keep playing for as long as you want.  It doesn't matter what gender you are, you can romance ANY of the 10 available. Are you a gal that likes other gals? Yep, you can woo, date, and marry them! Are you a dude that wants to smooch, woo, and marry other dudes? You can do that too! Guess what else you can do? If you're unable to have kids the traditional way you can ADOPT! You can have a family! Or if you don't want a kid you don't have to have one (at least, I'm pretty sure you don't have to).  All in all, 9/10 game that I plan on playing for a very long time!",1457351412,1457351412,1,129,14,0.886719882488251,2,1,0,0,0,

I've never played Harvest Moon or any other of that type of game, so I can't tell you how this one compares.  Here's a quick breakdown of the types of things you can do:  Farming (3 seasons, each 28 days long, crops take different amounts of time to harvest) Make wine, beer, maple syrup, pine tar, preserves, pickled vegetables. Ranching (chickens, cows, sheep, horses, slimes) Foraging (each season has specific items to find in the wild, berries, roots, ets) Mining (Delve deep in the mine to find ores, gems, and monsters to fight!) Fishing and Crab Pot (difficult to do at first, but lots of different fish to catch depending on location and time of day) Crafting (level up, get blueprints, make thing like bee houses, furnace, tapper, preserves jar, charcoal kiln and more) Cooking (upgrade your house to have a kitchen, get recipes, cook all kinds of stuff!) Socialize (meet the villagers, give gifts to make them like you, 5-10 candidates for marriage depending on if gay is ok) Family (expand your house, get married, have kids) Wal-Mart, er I mean Joja Mart (embrace corporate business models or support local small business -- prices cheaper at Joja) Rebuild the Community Center (little spirit things want you to rebuild the abandoned community center by bringing one of each type of certain things to form bundles.  Also it unlocks things later on I think, and you get free goodies for doing it.  But if you side with Joja mart they will tear it down to build a warehouse. Mini-Quests (check the postings outside the town store for reqeuests villagers have, like fetch me a radish, or kill 6 slimes in the mines, etc.  You get gold for these and the villagers will like you more.  2 day time limit, though.)  Oh, and you get either a dog or cat, but they don't anything productive, just wander around and sleep.  Now that you know what you CAN do, I'll tell you what you HAVE TO do.  Which is nothing!  No time limit.  No pressure.  Well, sure you should grow crops in the beginning so you have money, but you don't have to socialize and marry if you don't want to.  You don't have to forage or fish or mine.  Do whatever you want, whenever you want.  Though you don't get all the blueprints of everything you can bulid until you level up to certain levels.  It's not like Terraria where you can build whatever as long as you have the materials.  You could have the materials but not the blueprint yet so you can't craft it.  I think the key addicting thing about this game is the save point.  It only saves at night while your character sleeps.  You can't save whenever you want.  Which is good if a day is going badly, just back out and start that day over.  But bad for getting sleep in real life.  ""Oh, I'll just take a peek outside my house and see how my crops are doing.""  And I end up playing another day....and then another...!  The time of day moves quickly.  It takes a hour just for me to run down to the beach looking for stuff that washed up then over to the little plank bridge area for those pink things and back to town.  Shops close at 4 or 5pm so it's a race to get where you want and still forage along the way.  If you stay up past 1am you faint and lose some money or items or something.  I try not to have that happen.    The artwork is very detailed.  Check out the inside of some of the houses: posters on the kid's walls, different furniture and wallpaper in the living room. Trees, plants, flowers are beautiful in all seasons.  Music is pleasant but does not distract.  Honestly I don't hear it much of the time because I'm concentrating on what I'm doing.  Price is right.  You get a lot for your money.  The replayability is huge.   Choose this girl to marry this time, choose a different one in another playthrough.  Or be single.  Choose to rebuild the Community Center in one playthrough, go the JoJa route in another.  Highly recommended.  There's something for everyone in this game (unless you hate 2d games to begin with).  Parental warning: so far there's only been one questionable thing if you want your kids to play.  There is a slight reference to someone having an affair with a married person.  You're asked to find something and that item is in another person's room!  Oh gee, how did that get there?!  So far that's the only thing, other than the gay thing, that parents might be leery of for their young children to play this game.  **** Addendum ****  Over 200 hours into this game now.  Feels like 50.  I swear this isn't a game at all.  It's actually a space/time bubble trap built into the game to make time in the real world move faster. So you think you've only been playing for a little while but actually it's been hours, and you realize your throat is parched because you ran out of drink and couldn't tear yourself away from the game to get a refill, and also you realize you're about to pee your pants.  This game is the first thing I think of when I wake up.  Before I even get out of bed I'm going over a mental checklist of things to do.  Even worse, I get confused about what day it is in real life, and even what month, what season.  I see things in real life that remind me of the game, like a patch of tall grass and I'm like ""Oooh, I gotta switch to my scythe and cut that stuff down"".  Then a second later, ""Oh, wait, that's in the game, and I'm in real life.""   Or on Friday I think ""I gotta visit the Travelling Merchant some time today"" and then ""Oh, wait, that's in the game"".  Bottom Line, tl;dr version:  Run, don't walk, RUN AWAY!!!  As fast as you can before you too get sucked in and it's too late.  A black hole's got nothing on this game.    And now there's more content!  Will the madness ever end?  Will I ever see trees and grass and houses and farm animals in REAL LIFE again?!  Oh the humanity!",1457029091,1480009738,1,127,5,0.809913754463196,3,0,0,0,0,

[/h1]  Stardew Valley is a farming and social simulator developed by ConcernedApe. In Stardew, you decide to quit your boring job in the city to move out to a farm you recently inherited from you grandfather, just outside Pelican Town. The farm has been overrun by nature after it being left empty and unloved for many years, your job is to turn it around and start making money out of it. You’re not alone in Pelican Town and you’ll meet many of the townspeople in the first few days, Pelican Town rarely sees new people moving in so it’s a big deal when you turn up.  I’ve never played any of the games Stardew is compared to, Harvest Moon and the like, and so I took a bit of a gamble when I bought this game. Thankfully I was not disappointed and after playing twenty-five hours in just four days with no sign of stopping anytime soon I couldn’t be happier with this game. The game does throw you in at the deep end though so the official wiki is probably going to be your new best friend: http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki  The visuals of the game are similar to Terraria and Starbound but that’s where the similarities stop. Anyway, it’s a great looking game if you’re a fan of pixel graphics but even if you’re not, you shouldn’t write the game off. Everything in the game is well designed and fits in nicely with the style, it’s also a very colourful game making all the nicer to look at.   So, as you’d imagine, the main gameplay comes from farming. Each of the four seasons (which consist of twenty-eight days each) see a wide variety of different crops and flowers available for you to grow and you’ll be planting most of your crop at the beginning of the season. Some crops, like parsnips or melons, can only be harvested once before you’ll need to plant them with new seeds while others, such as corn and cranberries, will continue to produce fruit/vegetables for the rest of the season. Once the season ends, crops specific to that season will die and you’ll have to clear them away before planting new crops. You will want to plant a variety of crops, mainly for the Community Center bundles (more on that later) but it’s worth remembering that the more expensive the seeds are, the more valuable the end product will be. There are also fertilizers you can use before planting your crops which will increase the chance of high quality crops (you have basic, silver star (more valuable) and gold star crops (considerably more valuable)) as well as fertilizer that increases growth speed. It doesn’t end with planting them though, you’ll need to look after your crops by watering them each day (unless it’s raining in which case you don’t need to) as well as building scarecrows to keep crows away. You can also harvest or make artisan goods, such as honey or maple syrup which is done through special machines that you’ll need to unlock and then build.  Unlocks come with levelling up your five skills. Every time you increase a skill (skills are increased by simply using the skill so, for example, your fishing skill is increased by fishing) you’ll unlock new machines to build as well as increase your proficiency in that skill. Once you hit level five and level ten, instead of unlocking something to build, you choose a profession which will boost a certain area of that skill such as 10% faster crop growth for farming or +1 ore per vein for mining.  Speaking of mining, there are other things to do in Stardew. Mining, fishing and foraging are the main alternatives to farming but there’s also social things to do as well as restoring the Community Center. The first three are pretty self-explanatory but I’ll briefly talk about fishing. Fishing is the main part of the game argued about in the forums, personally I really like the fishing mini-game but many don’t. It consists of trying to keep a green bar behind a moving fish icon and for larger fish it can be quite challenging. However, as you increase your fishing skill and you yourself get more used to the mini-game it does become quite fun and a little less challenging, it’s also a great way to earn extra money when your farming chores are complete. The social side of things mainly consists of doing little quests for other characters, such as catching a certain fish for Gus (the Saloon owner) to use in a new recipe, but you can also give gifts to other characters to make you like them more. Giving enough gifts to one of the ten bachelors/bachelorettes in the game to get to ten hearts will let you propose to and then marry them, opening you up to the possibility of having kids in the game. The last thing here is the Community Center. The Community Center has long since fallen in to disrepair and once the Mayor unlocks the door for you you’ll be able to start building it back up by completing bundles of items. Each room has several different bundles for you to complete, completing each bundle will unlock a small reward and completing all the bundles for a given room unlocks a big reward, such as fixing mine carts which can be used for fast travel from three locations. The bundles are mainly for four items though some only require two and other require five.   The last big thing to touch on is house upgrades and livestock. There are two house upgrades that you can buy which will make your house bigger as well as unlock something new to do, the first upgrade is a kitchen which means you can cook food and the second upgrade adds child beds to your room which you’ll need if you want kids. To purchase these you’ll need a fair amount of gold as well as a specific amount of resources which the carpenter will ask for. You can also pay the carpenter to build you what you’ll need for keeping livestock, ranging from chickens in a coop to cows in a barn. Keeping livestock seems to be a lot more work for a lot less gain than farming crops but you can still get goods from the during winter while you can’t grow anything during winter (unless you’ve repaired the greenhouse through the Community Center). It is also possible to sells the livestock for a profit if you get them up to five hearts but I haven’t figured out how to do that yet.  Finally, the save system. The game automatically saves when you go to bed at the end of each day and there’s no way to manually save. This is another thing a lot of people have complained about, it also happens to be what makes the game so damn addictive. I often find myself doing a couple of things in the morning of a day before I turn the game off before realising that I’ll have to finish the day to save my progress. Since the first thing you’ll do each morning is chores you’ll find yourself, like I have several times, playing the rest of the day just so you don’t lose that progress. It can be frustrating if you need to go and don’t have time to finish off a day but it’s a clever way to keep players playing the game.  [h1]Verdict [/h1]  Stardew Valley offers players an incredibly relaxing and enjoyable experience through its farming simulator style gameplay, though there is more to it than that. Whether you’re a fan of similar games or you just want to try something new, I cannot recommend Stardew Valley enough!

I showered her with gifts. Time went on and I continued to do everything I could to make her like me. It was time for the spring dance, this was my chance. I went up to her and asked her if she would dance with me. She politely refused.  I went home and cried and did the same in Stardew Valley.   [h1]Real Review[/h1]  This game is fantastic and incredibly enjoyable. Somehow I have been able to amass 15 hours in the game already... after 2 days... during a school week... And there seems to be tons left to explore and unlock.  From mining, to fishing, to farming, and just exploring and having fun--I always feel like I have something to do, and with the wide variety of things to do, even if I get bored of one activity the other activity is so different that it becomes completely enjoyable again.   The gameplay is deep. You feel accomplished when you plant and water crops for the first time. You feel excited when you finally get to harvest the crops you've watered every day. Pulling up a big fish is equally satisfying and getting to the next level in the mines is fantastic.  Talking to NPCs isn't particularly exciting as there aren’t gobs of dialogue, but there's still a pleasant amount to keep me wanting to talk. Getting an NPC to like you makes me feel happy though. There could be a bit of polishing in this way, I've noticed a couple of spelling errors in the dialogue and sometimes wish I could know more about a character, but I'm still pleased with what there is.  I've never played Harvest Moon or Rune Factory, which I've heard is what this game was inspired from, so I can't say how similar it is to either, but since this is my first time playing a game like this, it has been awesome not knowing what to expect. But if you've played either game before and liked them I would assume this would be a great updated version for you.  Also, this game was [u]never in early access[/u] and was made by [b]one developer[/b], which is such a pleasant change from what has been.  [h1]The Good and The Bad[/h1]  [b]Pros[/b] [list] [*]Simple, diverse, satisfyingly enjoyable gameplay that is hard not to love even after hours [*]Unique, lively characters and a beautiful world to explore [*]Interesting developments in the story and characters that helps fill in the occasional slow parts of the game. [*]A lot of high quality gameplay. Spent 15 hours playing thus far and it seems like I've only scratched the surface. [*]Beautiful graphics for a pixel game [*]Well suiting music and sound effects that fit well into the mood of the game [*]Great map that might seem small at first but has a lot more depth to it than first thought [/list]  [b]Cons[/b] [list] [*]NPC dialogue could be better in my opinion [*]A few very minor bugs that don't affect much but should still be brought up [*]*spoiler maybe* You have to replant after each season, causing you to lose any currently planted crops (excluding a couple crops, like corn). It would be nice to know this ahead of time (or at least make it clearer) as it was quite frusturating for me to wake up to all my cauliflower that would have been ready in a few days now wilted... I know this may be obvious to HM players but to players new to the genre like myself, it would be nice if this was mentioned. EDIT: Players now receive a letter two weeks before end of spring stating that this happens. Thank you, dev! [*]The map showing the location of your character needs improvement, as it is now it just gives you a general idea of where you are, which isn't that bad, but I would prefer if it showed the exact location. [*]Night lighting could be improved. [/list]  [h1] TLDR; [/h1]  Stardew Valley is an amazing game, and going to go on my list as one of my favorites. Its intuitive, unique gameplay is fresh to see. I would say that it's probably not for everyone, but I think everyone could enjoy at least a part of it. Well worth the $14.99 price tag and excited to see what the developer has in store.",1456819712,1462010509,1,290,569,0.831080198287964,12,1,0,0,0,

Farming: On par with Harvest Moon (HM). Some extra details (need for scarecrows, fencing etc.) but it's also missing features like the ability to selectively breed superior levels of crops over multiple generations. There are some balance concerns but being a PC game those can actually be patched. Livestock... lacks variety and some complexity but is more realistic in some respects. For example there's no animal taming, just purchasing. Breeding is in but you don't breed better livestock it just replenishes numbers (and is gender blind). Grooming is more detailed but less hands on. The one noteworthy improvement is conceptually allowing and rewarding field rotation.  Relationships: Superior to HM and It's a Fantasy Life (FL), but inferior to Rune Factory (RF). I say superior to HM but really it's about on par in terms of the mechanics but with more romance options (including same sex). It falls behind in terms of character variety, depth and interaction compared to the RF series but updates could easily catch up.   (Note RF improved on the HM formula is pretty much every way so will be comparing primarily to it now)  Mining: On par with RF, Behind FL. One area it is behind in both respects is variety of ores divided by regions. Stardew Valley has 2 locations you can really go mining. They have a lot of levels, which are divided into different biomes and there's some RNG in ore availability on any given trip into the mines but it's still overall more simplistic terms of layout and progression. Where it really lags behind is the actual mining interaction. It's just click on the rock, it breaks, RNG loot.  Lumberjacking: This ones complicated as it's been mixed with the concept of Foraging. Lumberjacking by itself it close but still behind RF and way behind FL. Foraging also adds features such as getting tree seeds off trees for immediate replanting, finding seasonal wild plants (which you can in turn get seeds for and farm, eliminating the wild foraging once you've completed that seasons set), and at certain times of the year collecting berries. The other titles has these features (coloured grasses and fruit trees etc) but they weren't tied to a skill you could improve. Much room to improve here, especially in terms of the mechanics.  Fishing: Ahead of RF, Close but still Behind FL. Something that must immediately be pointed out is fishing difficulty isn't staggered so there's an easy progression curve. Where as in the other games the seasonal fish in the locations you have access to at the start are easy to catch & get harder as you unlock more areas and progress to later seasons, Stardew will throw you in the deep end right at the start before you have any skill. Plus the RNG will throw top level fish at you to kick your butt again & again. Practising the skill and improving equipment alleviates this over time but a lot of people think fishing is impossible starting out as although there are easy fish to catch to start, you aren't directed to them and RNG can still screw you. The mechanics themselves work well once you are on top of them but still more depth that could be added to compare to FL, but otherwise quite good.  Combat: Behind RF and FL. There's no real depth to the combat. 3 noteworthy weapon types (and you'll mostly just use swords) plus bombs (which you wont use in combat), no spells, no special moves (right click does do an alternate thing like block or ground slam, but it's not effective and you will never do it), no companions, no real footwork, just move close and spam attack over and over until enemy dies. The only tactical considerations are more frustration with the controls then strategy. Enemy variety is lacking compared to the others. First 80 levels there's only 3 varieties of enemies, those who passively stand there, ones that charge you (grounded or flying), and ones that charge you but occasionally block (one that burrows to do so). For all the above the strategy is pretty much the same: Maybe dodge, hit them before they hit you, keep hitting. Then they add enemies that shoot at you, same deal. Much room for improvement. That said the RNG nature of the dungeons leaves a lot or potential open for this to be developed further if the dev decided to so.  Crafting: Way behind RF and FL. No weapon/armour crafting at all. Equipment upgrades handled by a shop. Cooking and deco pieces are just click to create. Super simplistic and uninteractive. That said, there is one area of it where it is ahead of both RF and FL. Decoration... In addition to the ability to lay fences, paths etc. you get to prepare and place the foundation for additional farm buildings rather then the usual fixed locations when you unlock them. Except your house & greenhouse. You are free to place a large amount of functional and decorative furniture both (craftable & collectable) largely anywhere you want on the farm & to some extent all over the town as well. Doesn't compare with say Ultima, or a Minecraft/Terraria clone (omission intentional) but it's a big step up within this genre.   Festivals: Far behind RF. Once you've seen them once most the time you want to skip festivals in Stardew. They are mostly just low interaction cut scenes that waste your entire day (even when the festival says it will end at 2pm, you'll get home at 10pm, day over). You can't give gifts, go shopping or otherwise really interact with the townsfolk in any meaningful way on most festival days and very few of the festivals will attending offer any kind of benefit. The townsfolk don't really acknowledge your prowess or even if you attended at all or not.  Story: Behind RF & FL. The story is very simple and very lightly applied. The one interesting aspect of it is it seems to make a social commentary on small town independents vs corporate growth culture... But it's doesn't seem to penalise or judge the player regardless of which they favour, it just complements two different playstyles respectively. The plot really boils down to if your characters presence improves the lives of the other townsfolk in any noteworthy fashion over the course of 2 years or not. The hands off approach is great if you don't want the game jamming plot events down your throat while you want to focus on the farming sim, but it means when you are looking for context it is relying entire on the depth of it's character interactions, where it is sadly lacking compared to it's rivals.  These aren't shallow characters, but the arcs are short and arbitrary and there is very little individual interaction throughout. Some scripted events are cool but like the festivals the characters have no real self awareness of how they went down after the fact.  Collection: On par or better then RF/FL. Behind Animal Crossing. :-P Good potential here. Museum collection will be expanded in updates too.  Art/Music: Subjective but good quality regardless.  Overall: If you are looking for a story based game with more interactive gameplay mechanics It's a Fantasy Life is a better choice. As far as farming sim specifically goes Rune Factory has more depth and still stands as personal best in genre. I haven't mentioned polish until now as although Stardew is behind all competitors this is day 4 since release and there have been no less then 4 patches fixing most major issues and many smaller ones. When you consider this game was made by one person with no production studio to cover exhaustive QA it's unsurprising launch has been a little shaky. But regular patching will fix this (Edit: & largely has). An advantage of a PC release. Do I recommend it? Absolutely. It might not be best in genre but it's a solid entry, has the potential to improve and is definitely already the best on the PC platform and by extension steam.  If the genre appeals to you, get it. Easily worth the money.",1456798669,1480081861,1,815,24,0.924274444580078,24,1,0,0,0,

I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game.   [b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive.   [b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.  [b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.)   [b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice.   [b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you ""complete"" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did!   Yes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them.   And that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing.   Minutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into ""oh no it's time to sleep"". You will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back.

The glow of SNES Harvest Moon on a Yamaha tube television warmed your face as you toiled under a friendly Spring sun. Behind you in the kitchen, your parents exchanged urgent whispers -- you couldn't catch much, but it was hard to miss ""When do we tell him?"" and ""It's treatable,"" amidst your mother's tears.  You got a Gameboy that Christmas, which proved a welcome companion to every roadtrip in your family's faded red minivan. Harvest Moon GBC allowed you to keep harvesting carrots and picking flowers throughout 1998, the hum of wind against the passenger side window accompanying the game's serene soundtrack as you were driven around town to various doctor's offices and radiation treatments (which your mom promised wouldn't turn her into a lizard-person, even though you thought that would be okay. Lizards were strong, and their tails grew back -- what was wrong with that?)   In 1999 you got a Nintendo 64. You tried hard to smile when you opened it, even though you didn't feel that happy. Your mom wore wigs now, and even though you still thought she was beautiful she always disagreed when you or your dad told her so. Somehow, petting a cow and harvesting more carrots made you feel a little bit better about it all.  In 2003, you graduated high school. Your mom was too sick to attend the ceremony, but you knew she was proud of you. You unwrapped your graduation gift on the foot of her hospital bed, inside lay a used Gameboy Advance and Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town. You spend the rest of the night crying under your bedside lamp and planting carrots. College and all the changes it brings is only one season away -- but at this point, you figure more change can't possibly be bad.  Working your way through college, you graduate in 2008 -- a semester late, and a delay which you chalk up to life's constant ability to surprise us. Who could've guessed that your hand-me-down minivan would need a new transmission and new brakes just two weeks apart? Despite all the challenges, you graduate with honors. After the procession, you find your father waiting for you in the parking lot. He gives you a big hug and makes a joke about how today is the last day anyone in your family can wear a dress in public. Even though it's a graduation gown, not a dress, you humor him with a chuckle.   Once you get home, Dad slips you a small box adorned with red string tied clumsily in a bow. ""It's not much, but it's all--"" you cut him off, assuring him it's perfect. You don't even have a Nintendo DS, but you find one listed cheaply on Craigslist and agree to meet the seller in the parking lot of the local Dairy Queen. You bring the gifted copy of Harvest Moon DS: Island of Happiness along with you, so you can make sure the console works fine -- which it does.  Three hours later, you realize you're still in the parking lot of Dairy Queen -- choking back tears as you struggle against the game's poor implementation of the stylus and sluggish movement speed. Maybe you were wrong, maybe more change meant things getting worse and not better. You shove the DS into the glove compartment where it rattles for the entire drive home.  Over the next 8 years, life continues to surprise you. You meet a girl in the lobby of your office building. You offer to share your homecooked lunch with her the next day if she shares her homemade apple pie today. She reluctantly agrees. Two years go by, you give her plenty of flowers and take her on plenty of dates. You ask her to marry you. Again, she reluctantly agrees.  You find a new place and move in together. Your old red minivan dies and you buy a new car together (well, the car was used -- but it was still new to you.) You get a promotion. She quits her job. You start a garden in your backyard to spend more time together on weekends. She buys twelve types of herbs for her side. You plant carrots. Lots of carrots.   Before you know it, it's 2016. Your daughter just celebrated her third birthday. She finally fits into the blue dress Grandpa gave her for Christmas -- you send him a picture of her wearing it with a message that reads ""Looks like I won't be the only one wearing dresses in the family anymore."" He responds, ""What?"" -- but you call him to remind him of your conversation back after your college graduation and he laughs. You swap fond memories of mom til your wife appears in the doorway to ask you for help tucking Lucy into bed. After reading a bedtime story, you decide to hop on Steam and play something before you hit the hay yourself.  Stardew Valley pops up on the front page. You buy it on a whim and start a new game. The screen fades in on a sickly family member lying in bed, handing you one final gift before they depart. That gift is a deed to an old farm and a new life. You take a survey of the land and begin farming, exploring caves, and harvesting carrots. It's as if Harvest Moon has changed again, only this time for the better. As you toil under the Spring sun once again, you finally feel at home.",1456646911,1456647117,1,77,8,0.864029586315155,12,1,0,0,0,

[*] Unconventional livestock. A fan of mallard ducks (yes, the meme)? Cute bunnies? Truffle-finding pigs? Sure, the game has it all! And no, no bacon, sorry peeps! [*] Crafting system. A D.I.Y mechanism that positively encourages you to be creative and not lazy. Need those precious bee house, scarecrow, keg, furnace? Go and build them yourself! [*] Let your livestock graze outside and feed on fresh, luscious grasses. It will make your farm look nicer and it's a win-win situation (happy animals and happy you, since you don't have to have to feed them hay). [*] Personalised play style. There are skills in the game (i.e. farming, mining, foraging, fishing and combat) that you can level up, so you can focus on particular skill(s) if you are interested in it/them. [b]Plus[/b], it gives you *secret* perks when you reach certain levels.  [/list]  [b]The Baddies[/b] [list] [*] Main character's movement and animation sometimes feel clunky. [*] Very minimum quest direction, which can make it harder for players to notice that they have to go / do / have a certain thing to trigger the quest event reaction. [/list]  [b]The Uglies[/b] [list] [*] Like similar themed game, Stardew can be tedious (especially in the beginning), repetitive and even frustrating at times. But it does not take away the fun! [*] The 'assumed knowledge' game is strong with this one. A large proportion of behaviours in the game follow Harvest Moon system (for instance, seasonal crops wilting when the season ends, talking to people/animals increase the affection meter and the only save point being when your character goes to sleep). This is NOT a negative feature, but it does make it a tad more difficult for new players to pick these things up. Worry not though, you'll still have fun and you can always look up information anyway! [*] This is just an odd thing to see, but none of the building has an increased exterior size when you upgrade them, when it obviously gets more spacious inside. Harry Potter sorcery!

It isn't about the 3D graphics that makes this game genre great but rather the gameplay and the amount of content this game comes with. This game is a piece of gem among indie games and I rarely say this when it comes to indies since there is so many. Might not be your cup of tea if you do not enjoy that type of series but then again that is unless you also own a console. If you never tried this series before take a look below or try it. Will be creating a great guide for new players to be the best farmers and to understand the mechanic. Will also update the review as new contents/ multiplayer releases.  [h1] Video Review [/h1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGGjsM6nJYg  [h1] Pros [/h1] + The game offers resolutions, bindable keys for keyboard, controller support (Xbox controllers),  and even Rumble support, insane! + 4 seasons of gameplay and years with weather system and natural disaster surprises + Game mechanic is great, 1 min for an hour ingame, energy bar to control what you can do in a day, and a punishment system of losing gold if you tire out, fail to sleep at 2 am, or even lose all your health.  With so much things to do you feel like you never have enough time as an illusion even though you really are playing quite a bit from 6 am to 1 am. + Great music, sound effects, and good looking 2d art which are funny and cute. + Multiple dialog answers to certain people at certain times. [h1]⦿THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENTS SUCH AS⦿[/h1] ‣Exploration -Explore desert, sewers, and a mine which acts as a sort of dungeon with over 80+ floors! while upgrading weapons and a bit of armor killing monsters. Tons of secrets to find and explore   ‣Making Money +being able to do farming assortments of vegetables during certain seasons and being able to grow trees, take out sap etc so much more +Growing a livestocks and being able to benefit from them, LIVESTOCK EMPIRE with chickens and cows +Forage items in the forest from woods, stones and plantlife. Just randomly picking up random things + Mining and adventuring to make money is addictive. + Fishing is included which is tough a bit but gets better as you progress -+Crafting mechanic in game to craft aesthetics, useful house addons, or even machines and devices that makes life easier which are witty and then being able to place them. + You can cook and be Gordon Ramsay by learning recipes from TV or level it through discovery. + So much questing, helping townspeople and taking request quests from the boards which helps earn some pocketchange and also increase relationship with the people around you besides giving them gifts. + Encounter events that comes with cutscenes with the ability to skip them too if you seen them which is a nice feature for multiple replays. + Being a friend to the local museum and donating to them to great rewards you can also do rewards wait until the community town hall opens for even more rewards!  ‣Use of money!? - + Expand your house, have people check your crib when you get your kitchen etc lol. + Upgrading your gears to go in the mines. Shoes, Rings and even Weapons such as daggers, swords, clubs and slingshot. + Upgrading your farm to add various buildings and special buildings for livestocks etc. + Interacting with community and gifting them to progress. + Taking part in minigame festivals that are seasonal and plenty. + Getting married to the bachelors available, whichever sex you want and whoever is available with thier own unique content, choice is yours.  There are a ton more stuff but I won't spoil them and my words are limited, so limited that I cannot even LIST IT ALL FOR YOU, There are tons of items and special secrets to discover, Plenty. There is always more each time you accomplish something, something else opens up. Multiplayer comes later because this was released to let the people enjoy the SINGLE PLAYER. Possible content later on? Hopefully!  [h1] Cons [/h1] - The fighting mechanic could definitely be improved on, standing around spamming clicks to swipe enemies can get tedious at times. - More emphasis on the pet system, you can only choose dog or cat but after that you don't really do anything with them except ignore them running around the farm. Give them water sometimes but no food. - Bugs in the game that can cause entire restarts to your game because of no manual save since the game is newly released.( The dev is fixing it up as they pop up and already has dedicated time into this be warned ahead of time!) - Lack of tutorial for new players ( game expected that players recognize the rules from games such as Harvest moon, rune factory, animal crossing etc. (I am working on a super guide for you guys on this) - The GUI (interface) could be much better with drag and drop features so you have to click and being careful on not reselling items you bought by mistakes or even pressing escape because you click too fast, I have resold my 50 seed bags by mistakes DOH! or rebought the same gears. - Alot of systems can be a bit more in depth later on to add challenge, such as vegetables rotting etc. Would be nice! (not really a con but nice idea to add more challenge)   [h1]⦿Conclusion⦿[/h1] These are just some of the things listed in the content becuase that was what important while playing the game, The sheer amount of content created by one person was mind boggling. This game is really special and sometimes it might be or might be your cup of tea but if you take your time and dive into one of the listed content above and really try it out you might be too late for that refund. 15 bucks for hundreds of hours here and also multiplayer coming later on. You tell me if thats worth the value. I've spent over 50+ hours so far",1456567909,1457417074,1,371,11,0.882071435451508,11,1,0,0,0,

I can honestly say that it has more charm than any of the more recent Harvest Moon games. I grew up with (M)FoMT and BtN and this game has me as hooked as those two did. The events feel organic, characters feel fleshed out and diverse and there are always things to do. The depth of this game is astounding; you can harness lightning bolts and sprinklers and mine cart fast travel - the list goes on.  Fishing is theraputic. Farming and designing your land is theraputic. Speaking to the villagers and watching events is engaging. This game is just an incredibly comfortable, addictive experience and I would fully recommend it to anyone.",1456539196,1456539196,1,180,8,0.886747419834137,0,0,0,0,0,

But If you don't ... I strictly recommend you to buy it! This game is made with passion, I was lucky enough to win an early copy, and the game is really smooth, you may encounter one or two bugs in the first 12~ hours of gaming, but if you send them to the (sole!!) developer he will surely address them. He really made this game with all his dedication and love, for about 4 years. It is a feat acomplished by few guys today. The game has a charming story and characters so far, lots of activities, collectables, you can harvest plenty of crops, have different animals, fish lots of different water creatures and the game has the right dificult to accomplish things, making you happy at every time you are able to upgrade your tools, build a new barn, etc. The game has some combat in it giving some flavour of RPG. It will sure make you smile and have good sensations that lot of the games lack today.  It is totally worth the price, for the ammount of time of gaming you have. I've played more than 8 hours and I barelly scratched the surface of this game is. It is garanteed to have lots of updates, cause ConcernedApe loves what he does. A strong candidate to best indie game of the year.",1456510006,1456510006,1,158,6,0.833619236946106,0,0,0,0,0,

If you enjoyed Harvest Moon, Rune Factory or Animal Crossing - then get this. It captures all the same things that made those games great, and it's the perfect game to play either casually or seriously. There are so many different ways to earn money and they're all developed and fun, the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing.  The progression curve in the game is fantastic too. Every day you'll feel like you're making progress but there's still always something to work towards and you won't 'beat it' after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible, as there's always something to spend your money on. Even after 20 hours of playing, I feel like I'm nowhere near the endgame, and I could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently. I'm even doing a playthrough on YouTube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages.  I'm easily disappointed by games, so you can imagine my surprise when I was so impressed by a game made by one person. Congratulations, ConcernedApe, you've made one of the best games I've ever played.",1456509669,1456509669,1,953,45,0.949349820613861,33,0,0,0,0,
