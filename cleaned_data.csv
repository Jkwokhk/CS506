While this is a positive change on the surface, the implementation of EOS was so mishandled it's caused irreparable damage to the Steam version.  [h2]EOS Dependency[/h2] Instead of implementing EOS in a proper way, the devs elected to simply disable the Steam matchmaking services that the game has been using for the past ~10 years, and replaced it with EOS. This was done very hastily, and has caused numerous issues. It also means that if EOS is ever down, you can not play online. So now the game is dependent on both Steam [i]and[/i] EGS being online.  It's also causing connections to lobbies to time out, fail, or just be more unstable.   I should mention that the EOS switch normally only effects finding and joining lobbies (see comments). Once you connect to the host the lobby becomes a p2p connection based on the host's connection.  [B]Edit:[/b] It appears Steam is still alive under EOS. The command -steamMM should work to give Steam priority over EOS. This lets you match with anyone using this command. It's still unstable and a bit buggy, but mods could probably patch most issues. It's not the best solution as I've only been able to play 1 game w/o getting disconnected.  [h2]Distance Filter Removal.[/h2] Previous to u237, users could adjust the maximum lobby latency limit when searching for games. This let you know what servers were closer and would have better latency. Now, all servers listed in CrimeNet have a random latency. This means you can just as easily connect to someone in Russia with 374 ping as you can with someone across the street with 5 ping.  As someone already checked in the EOS documentation, EOS does not have any way to check the latency of a host unless you connect to them first. So this feature was removed simply because EOS client couldn't support it.  [B]EDIT:[/b] Clarification, the distance filter has not been [i]entirely removed[/i], it's simply dependent on Steam Matchmaking to work. But since PD2 uses EOS, it will not function.  [h2]Harder to Find Lobbies[/h2] Because no testing was put into finding the differences between Steam and EOS matchmaking, the CrimeNet menu is almost entirely unusable at the moment. Lobbies will appear on your screen for a maximum of [b]5 seconds[/b] (yes, this is the actual measured time) before being replaced with another group of lobbies. Even when this list refreshes, many of the listed lobbies are already full and can't be joined anyway. And only 10-15 lobbies are being shown at a time, despite having the maximum server filter set to 40.  [b]EDIT[/b]: As of u237.1, lobbies only refresh every 10 seconds now. This is still a downgrade, as it still scrambles every lobby that's displayed. Old lobbies used to stay in the same spot and just update their player counts.  [h2]Invites Dead[/h2] Because the matchmaking service was switched to something other than Steam, friend invites no longer work anymore. The invite feature has now been replaced by a slower, clunkier, and overall [b]worse[/b] interface that works with EGS players. The old ""Friends Lobbies"" tag in CrimeNet is also not working right now, so that method is gone as well.  [b]EDIT:[/b] Some people are reporting that steam invites still work. Others (like me) can't get them to work. So this appears to be somewhat functional, but not as it was prior to the update.  [h2]The Social Hub[/h2] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986912867 In place of the Steam Friends menu, the devs created a menu called the ""Social Hub"". This allows you to view online friends and join their games. First off, it visually unhelpful. It provides less information than the previous Steam Friends menu, is slower to navigate, and the top tabs aren't even aligned properly with the menu.  Now to explain how the new invite system works:[list] [*]The host starts a lobby, and copies the ""lobby tag"" that's plastered to the top of their screen. [*]This code must then be manually sent to every friend who wants in. [*]These friends must then input this code into CrimeNet, which [i]should[/i] make the lobby appear.[/list]  For reference, the old system was:[list] [*]Your friends click ""Join Game"" on you in Steam.[/list] This entire system was implemented just so EGS users could join the lobbies of Steam friends. In all forms, this is a pure downgrade for Steam users. There's also a bug where the lobby code box becomes stuck on your screen during gameplay, and covers up part of your screen.  [h2]Linux Support[/h2] While native Linux support was originally going to be dropped ""due to features in the new heist"", it instead happened with the EOS switch. While we can't [i]assume[/i] the devs [u]flat out lied[/u] about why Linux Support was being dropped, we all knew that there was no way a heist would simply not work on a specific OS. The Diesel engine is not as ""outdated"" as you think, and the updates to Raid:WW2 have proven that good developers can make anything work on it.  Otherwise, Linux players can now use Proton to continue playing the game. The problem with this is that Proton is the embodiment of ""works on my machine"". Some users have reported no issues. Some have massive fps drops. Some have found huge memory leaks. The problem with killing native OS support and forcing users to use a compatibility tool is that the tool itself doesn't work in a consistent way.  [B]EDIT:[/b] As it's been pointed out, it was never said that Linux was going to be sunset, but just not receive the latest heist. So to kill off the entire branch instead is very questionable, and gives the impression that Starbreeze didn't want to maintain it anymore. Under their own wording, Linux users [b]should[/b] have received this update, and all future updates [i]except[/i] for the next heist.  [b]EDIT:[/b] Going to be adding stuff here as I find it/need to explain something. [h2]Side-Jobs[/h2] I gave the devs the benefit of the doubt with this. I assumed they had just broken how the game tracks Side-Job completion, and all save data was still intact.  Well I was proven dead wrong, because u237 [b][u]completely wiped Side-Job save data of every user[/u][/b]. Anyone who happened to run the game yesterday on u237 had all Side-Job progress [b]deleted[/b]. The patch today (u237.1) confirms this, as they had to award everyone who had launched u237 all Side-Job rewards.   Saves from the u236 version that did not load the u237 update, and instead go right to u237.1, still have all Side-Job data retained. Which proves that u237 indeed wiped all Side-Job data.  How do you, as a developer, fuck up [i]this bad[/i]? How did you not catch this?  [h2]Quality of Lobbies[/h2] Since u237 & the patch, connections in general have become much more unstable. EGS players frequently crash at the endscreen of heists, and have major trouble joining lobbies with Steam players.  [h2]Save Corruption[/h2] Well it's been confirmed. While reports have started popping up, it's finally confirmed that u237 is corrupting save files. While nobody can repro it yet, we're almost positive it's because Social Hub data is now also saved to your save file. The data is save in a way that's rather volatile, and can do strange things if odd data is input (which can happen when your saving hundreds of usernames).  Back up your save data yo.  [h2]Mod Support[/h2] Starbreeze [u]did not[/u] intentionally kill mods. The pd2.exe needed to be updated in order to support EOS, which happens [b]rarely[/b]. This edit broke BLT simply because it was no longer compatible with the current exe. [u]BLT is already working again[/u], as it simply needed to be updated. Starbreeze was not out to kill mod support, it was simply such a large update that BLT needed to update as well",1686323942,1686938516,0,2106,19,0.948146283626556,98,1,0,0,1,

Payday 2 is a coop heisting / shooting game , you mainly play 2 ways , Loud or stealth In loud you fight a bunch of different ennemies , from regular cops , to ninjas that one shot you with a roundhouse kick (called cloakers) to big bois in bomb suits (called Bulldozers)  In stealth... well you try to be stealthy , not get seen by the guards or camera and rob different places  Positive points :  - The content , there is a LOT of DLCs , maps , weapons , heisters , cosmetics etc , no wonder people in your friend list probably have 200+hrs on that game and some may even be at 1000+ hours , this game can be played for thousands of hours without a sweat - The gameplay is pretty nice and actually pretty innovative when you compare it to other generic shooters , you have a range of weapons from bows to grenade launchers to fight your ennemies with and the stealth aspect is really great when you learn how to master it - The musics are really cool in my opinion - The story is not explained at all in a correct way in the game ... then why is it in positive points ? because the story is insanely good , look it up on youtube you won't be disappointed I swear - The mods available on internet for this game are absolutely BONKERS , there are HUD mods (a must have in my opinion) , quality of life , custom maps , custom weapons , cosmetics , if the base + dlc content was not enough for you , the mods will give you another 2000hrs+ of interesting content easily   Negative points : - Some gameplay aspects can feel glitchy if you are not understanding them , you will need a couple of youtube guide stops before really getting all the game mechanics , especially in stealth - We have a choice paradox , especially for newer players , it is hard to choose what kind of build to go for with so many options available and so little direction given by the game , that said most builds even the most randoms could work if you know how to play around their strengths & weaknesses  - The alternative game modes like holdouts are not really interesting - Some maps feel old , for example the classic bank heist , which is probably one of the first you will do consist of taking control of the bank , then waiting for a drill to finish before moving bags of loot , and the only fun part is taking control of the bank , so yeah some older maps definitely feel outdated and would need a small rework to really be interesting to new players in 2022 - Public lobbies... yeah stay out of that and play with friends  Global opinion of the game: Payday 2 is one of my favourite game , it is familiar enough that anyone who played at least 1 fps before should be able to understand every basic aspect of the game quite quickly but it is innovative enough that you can play for thousands of hours and still be entertained , with friends the experience is even better , may it be Loud or Stealth you will have fun for sure. Is it a must buy ? Definitely  Will you get ruined from the bunch of DLC that you will want after getting a taste of the game ? of curse That being said , the game is on sale really often and right now you can find it with most of it's DLCs on humble bundle so you should definitely give it a shot  It is my first english review so if it was useful to you , don't hesitate to put a thumbs up to let me know !

Letting players commit an incredible crime spree as they rob everything from Money to Gold to Nuclear Bombs. Since it's release in 2013, PAYDAY 2 has been continuously updated after all these years with new content to keep things fresh thanks to the game's infamous use of tons of DLC packs. It's certainly one of the most uniquely structured first person shooters ever in terms of style, personality, and gameplay.  Gameplay of PAYDAY 2 takes a lot from Modern Shooters, With sprinting, iron sights, and a slight focus on cover. However, what makes PAYDAY 2 different from all those generic shooters is practically everything else. Heists either range from simple bank jobs to absolutely ludicrous heists and it doesn't shy away from having some incredible and memorable heists. They often more or less feel like real places that you're robbing either loud with guns-ablazin or stealthy by lurking in the shadows. Gunplay of PAYDAY 2 is pretty much what you'd expect from a modern shooter but the sheer amount of weaponry as well how much fun it is to shred down squadrons of SWAT and it's not boring for how much the enemies and rip you to pieces if you're not careful which helps reduce the game of just mindless shooting. Furthermore you're allowed to choose what kind of armor you have, a multitude of equipment to help you out, Skill and Perk decks to give you game changing special abilities, and insane amounts of melee weapons if bullets just aren't enough. Lastly for gameplay there are a multitude of different difficulties to adjust to how skilled you are and as a reward get more cash in the process.  One HUGE aspect that I adore about PAYDAY 2 is how much of the game is customizable. Starting with weapons, not only can you out fit EVERY single weapon with gadgets, sights, stocks, etc to your liking but thanks to Weapons Colors and Skins from free drops you can customize the appearance to suit your needs. But that pales in comparison to one of the most iconic parts of this game, Your Mask. Not only are there 100+ masks to choose from but nearly infinite ways to customize with materials, patterns and 2 colors to personally craft the perfect mask for you, plus some masks are nods to other games or internet culture. Lastly you also have the ability to customize the skin on your armor similar to Weapons Skins but also have entire full outfits that while not as customizable fit well with PAYDAY 2's theme of customization.  Another thing PAYDAY 2 does extremely well is having a ton of character. While the setting and weapons are undoubtedly kinda generic at times. The characters, from the heisters themselves to even the Police Force have that extra characterization that prevents them from being generic cops and robbers. For Example, a majority of the Heisters come from different countries making each heister unique in both personality and how they sound, like Dallas' signature ""Medic Bag"" lines or Sydney's Australian chaotic-ness. Each one brings something new and doesn't feel like a carbon copy of each other. Like before even the Police have this sense of character, mainly with the special units, such as the Cloaker or Bulldozer with their constant taunts and chatter. This even seeps into their variations in different countries or other factions. Even your mission guides have a ton of character from the iconic Bain, to the Russian Vlad, the mysterious Dentist and many more.  Of course I couldn't make a PAYDAY 2 review without talking about the absolute fantastic OST. Simon Vikland not only voices Bain and the Cloaker but also composed the majority of this game's stellar soundtrack and with his spiritual successors carrying that touch of having some outstanding tunes. I feel the reason why PAYDAY 2's soundtrack is so well regarded is that while it often does the electronic, loud music it's never too shy to try other genres and make them work so well. Some tracks include Jazzy instruments, others completely with classic guitars and drums, some with inspiration from outside culture such as Mexico, others go for a grand musical style with Opera singers, one straight up makes it's own 80s-like song complete with lyrics and there is even Badass Clown Music! PAYDAY 2 wouldn't be the same without it's incredible soundtrack.  Overall, PAYDAY 2 is a great time, either going alone or going with a squad, it excels to continuously being fun while repeating gameplay which boosts it's replay ability. Furthermore as of this review, PAYDAY 2 is still being updated so it's never shy of having new content to be played. Really the only truly bad thing I can think off is how poor the driving controls are which is ironic since this game runs on the Diesel Engine, a Engine made for driving games. With PAYDAY 3 hitting stores in a few years I can't wait to see what our favorite band of heisters will get up too soon!",1635337312,1637786324,1,59,5,0.800061285495758,0,0,1,0,0,

If you've seen my other review on another game, you might know my cousin.  Once again, he was the one who recommended this game to me. Being the gamer that he is, he would constantly be leading all the heists and missions while I meekly followed behind trying to help.  The sheer variety and creativity in each individual heist is incredible. From your normal bank heists, to breaking and entering the White House; You will never be bored of this game.  Not only that, but pushing yourself and your friends to the limit is possible with so many difficulties.  There were moments where we were over an hour into the mission already, getting so difficult and tough to move forward, but we persevered (also because we put in so much time already), and always ending with a huge feeling of accomplishment.  And if you know me, you'd know I love the customisation functionality. I love the masks. I love them so much!  -  Îã§Î•∏ Í≤åÏûÑÏóêÏÑú Îã§Î•∏ Î¶¨Î∑∞Î•º Î≥∏ Ï†ÅÏù¥ ÏûàÎã§Î©¥ ÎÇ¥ ÏÇ¨Ï¥åÏùÑ Ïïå Ïàò ÏûàÏäµÎãàÎã§.  Îã§Ïãú ÌïúÎ≤à, Í∑∏Îäî ÎÇòÏóêÍ≤åÏù¥ Í≤åÏûÑÏùÑ Ï∂îÏ≤ú Ìïú ÏÇ¨ÎûåÏù¥Îã§.

Gave it a try, loved it. Game made me feel like a bad-a$$ robber in every way. Even though it had limited amount of maps, it kept me occupied for a long time (I still boot up that old thang, just to get a dose of nostalgia). I craved for MORE. Naturally, I was expecting PAYDAY 2 with huge hype.   Year 2013, enter: PAYDAY 2. When I have booted up the game, never have I imagined I'd be playing this thing for over +7 years! Hell this thing was one of the reasons of my break up with my back then girlfriend, because I was playing it so much!  I still remember my first heist - a Jewelry Heist that I did on Normal difficulty with a friend of mine. Equipped with nothing but an AMCAR and a Chimano, we joined a random lobby. The sounds of gunshot echoing, the pressure of SWAT's rushing into the store, the clinging of a broke drill, my precious AMCAR's reloading, bullets and shells flying everywhere, Simon's beats exploding into my ears.. Everything was so thick, so... Real. I was literally there, trying to survive against a horde of cops. HOLY $HIT, what a ride them first 100 levels were. The characters didn't interact and chat like they did in PD:TH - but it was allright. Whether you were trying to cook meth under a police assault, trying to figure out which ingredient to add whilst pushing off the intruders or sneaking around in a senators house, trying to frame him and grab the coke while dodging his many guards with a suppressed pistol... How many of us failed on Big Oil's engine selection numerous times, trying to figure out what to pick?   Didn't matter. This was f**king awesome on every level. This was THE $HIT!  Over the years, PAYDAY 2 accumulated a huge fanbase. I've almost never seen anything like this in my +15 years gaming experience. Every live action movie tipping its hat towards a new heist, new character, a new feature.. Millions of people watching them and hyping up.. Y'all remember Hoxton Breakout? An entire community literally asking for our old charismatic British thief? The events and the expectations? Every new heist that was released, with a banger from Viklund? Players taking their favourite character, and actually roleplaying like them. Driller Wolf's, Inspire Dallas', LMG carrying Chains' - this game built a NEW REALITY. I myself even wrote an appreciation message to Damion Poitier (Chains' voice actor) some years back and got a reply on Instagram. I still keep that message as a memoir for the good times! This was the kind of $hit this game stirred up.  I'm not going to comment too much on the new +20 heisters and how they somehow got integrated into the story loosely. It should've stopped at Hoxton, when we released him from the jail. Hell I can even accept the Wick. But most of the new characters broke the games originality and personality - VERY far away from the PD:TH spirit. The character's individuality have diminished, reduced to nothing more than a small description in the loadout screen. This is just my humble opinion. But I get it, they were trying to make money, and keep the fanbase busy exc exc. BUT:  Over time, things just seemed like a cashgrab from Overkill's end. The safes, the character packs with one or two weapons... I'm still amazed how they built such a strong universe and a fanbase - and managed to take a decision to release drills [spoiler] or Goat Simulator heist, for that matter [/spoiler]. What a turmoil that was, the reviews went to Mostly Negative. They managed to piss off the entire community who have been backing them throughout the years.. Yadda yadda - I won't repeat history. One way or another, the devs made an amazing game, patched it and added new content for over 7 years, mostly fixed their f*ck-ups. I happily bought all DLC's to show my support.  I waited and waited till I made a review, to see the final product, to see where this game would come to. In the end, this thing wasn't just a game, it was an organism that evolved over the years - and still does. It still attracts me after all these years. The hype I felt for PAYDAY 2 is still here, but now for PAYDAY 3. Let's do this.

I like this game, it's incredibly fun to play with friends, but it may not be very fun if you are a solo player. I will focus this review on Gameplay Balance of this game, as I feel like it is what both makes and breaks this game for some players.  DIFFICULTIES. This game offers several difficulty levels for people to play around with (7 Difficulties in total).  Most of them are pretty decent. With my favorite difficulty being the 2nd highest - Deathwish. The highest difficulty in this game pulls a lot of bullshit to make it actually ""challenging"" (like making enemies deal obscene amounts of damage to you, eliminating most gameplay builds from being viable, leaving only select few Builds as ""good enough"" performers on a regular basis. Does that mean that you ABSOLUTELY can not run your favorite ""non-meta deck"" on the higher difficulties? No, you still can, but the ""META"" builds just are less affected by the bullshit thrown by Death Sentence. Which, in my opinion, is not a good gameplay design.  GAMEPLAY BUILDS AND PLAYSTYLES. The game has experienced INSANE Power Creep (new skills and perk decks becoming obviously more powerful than what the game started out with) during its development. Newer Perk Decks (core part of your gameplay build and what basically defines your playstyle) tend to be much stronger than older perk decks. Some Perk Decks are outright worse version of others, or just are so bad that there is no merit to using them even on lower difficulties.  MODDING. This game is quite mod-friendly, and you can customize a lot of gameplay aspects of this game, from simple quality of life mods, to straight up gameplay-changing mods that can alter the logic of the game. There are also several mods that completely alter the gameplay experience, completely re-balancing existing gameplay elements, and introduce new elements to make the game feel fresh.  The game has shitloads of DLCs, some are weapon packs, some are heist packs, some are characters. This game has a lot of weapons, but most of them have very similar stats, and weapons could be broken down into key categories that suit different styles of gameplay. You do not NEED these DLCs to be good at the game, but some of the perk decks/weapons mods provided by them are much better than their vanilla counterparts. They tend to be cheap on sale, at least.

As you can see, I received over 1100 hours on record when I was writing this review. So, I hope you will agree that my opinion about this game worth something, right? So, let's jump straight into details, shall we?  ""In the year 2013, a daring crew of reckless criminals unleash a torrent of chaos upon Washington, D.C.. Backed by the reclusive genius mastermind Bain, these clown-masked culprits stop at absolutely nothing to drain the city's vaults and fill their own greedy pockets, causing chaos and destruction wherever they go. These are the adventures of... the PAYDAY Crew!""  These words came here from April's Fools 2018 joke - PAYDAY: Animated Series. Despite the fact these series were just a joke, they describes the whole PAYDAY 2 very accurate. You have something valuable and you hired GenSec or Murkywater to protect it? Be sure that PAYDAY Gang will pay you a visit!   Alright, now seriously - it's a 4-player coop shooter that allows you to feel yourself a professional criminal, who is tough enough to enter the bank and leave it 20 minutes later, 600 bullets poorer and $6M dollars richer. You don't have any friends to play with or just simply don't like the idea of co-op game? Don't worry, you have bots that will cover your ass and ""GET THE FUCK UP"" you if you will accidentially die with cops to the left of you and cloakers to the right, while being stuck in a middle with a bulldozer.   And what if you don't like to enter the place with guns ablazing? This game will keep you covered in that case, because a lot of contracts in this game can be stealthed. Imagine yourself robbing the biggest vault you can ever think of while not shooting any single bullet! In this game you easily can do that.  Over 150+ weapons. Over 70+ contracts. Over 20+ characters. A lot of scenarios to rob the same place - thanks to the RNGesus and preplanning feature. 2 additional game modes. 7 difficulties availiable. One deadly gang.  Let this game introduce itself to you, give it shot and maybe you will find yourself staying here for over 1000+ hours. I did.    Here will come a little (or not so) afterwords. For those, who just wanted to discover what this game is - you can go now, i will tell my own storyline with this game below. For those, who interested in that storyline - I hope you won't be dissappointed.  As Store Page mentions, this game was released on August 13, 2013. That was a long time ago. I came to this game in July, 2018. Almost near the end of development. Through my 1157 hours of playing this game, I heard a lot of reviews about it from other players. Some praised it, some scolded it. I can understand both sides of this coin. This game came through a lot of changes and some people couldn't find themselves in liking it. OVERKILL Software did some mistakes during development. Some people want them to go bankrupt, calling PAYDAY a ""dead game"". Some people are hyped for PAYDAY 3. And some people actually want to support OVERKILL Software, considering the situation that happened to them in 2018. I'm one of them. I just want to hope that they will do something good with our support. Remember - it's hard to work properly when everyone around is only cursing on you. Give the developers a chance to fix their mistakes. Please.  You can think my opinion is too positive. And you are right. This game became to me something more than just game. This was my first 100% achievements game. And always will be. I met here a lot of good people, who helped me with my achievements, my OD mask or just sticked with me playing this. I cannot but mention them.

And I hope it wasn't the last time we met each other here. See you at the safehouse!  Here my story ends. I don't know for how long I will stay in this game, but as for now, I'm still here, trying to bring something good in this game's community. I'm maybe not the best teammate, but I hope you will be able to call me a good one.  Let's see what PAYDAY 3 will give to us I assume?

I love the option of going loud or stealth. Theres plenty of missions, and often multiple ways of completing them which keeps it interesting. I've hit the max possible level, and im still learning. For me, the satisfaction in completing a mission ive been trying to solo for ages is immense, and even though ive now completed every mission on the hardest difficulty, the enjoyment is still there. I like the option of reseting your account, so you start from scratch again. So many positives about this game i couldnt list them all. As for negatives, there really isnt many. A couple of little bugs, but nothing game breaking. One thing i will say is a fairly big negative, is CrimeSprees. Its easily abused to allow new players to hit max level in a few hours. Which makes them appear far more experienced than they really are. Max level should take around 300hrs, buts its possible in 3 with this exploit. So it forces me to use a mod, that will tell me a players hours when they join my game, and ive banned many players from joining that dont have a realistic amount of hours for their level. I often play with new players, and try and teach them the nessasary skills, but i dont like players who fake being a experienced player, but dont even know the basics. That is one thing i would change about this game in a heartbeat, but everything else is pretty much perfect imo. Worth every penny (and its not much).

The developers made a lot of monetization mistakes in the past and you will find a lot of negative/old reviews for that. However, monetization (one-pack-buy-all-DLCs) is currently fine and quite cheap.  [b]Pros:[/b] - Really a blast, enjoyable gaming experience most of the times. - Quite a lot of people still play this, and it seems to be stable. - You can play solo or with friends, or even public lobbies aren't bad, provided you use some filters (more on this later). - Tons of mods, some good and some bad. They range from blatant cheats (FU) to customizable HUD and some gameplay fixes (these are <3). - Insane weapons variety, and I mean it, there are so many weapons to choose from that I'll be lucky if I played half of them in 600h+ gameplay. You want a Mosin Nagant and feel like in WWII again? You can have that. You want a minigun and feel like in GTA San Andreas? You can have that too. - A *lot* of maps and heists available, some of which can be completed either in stealth or loud. - You like to run around guns blazing? You can play loud. - You like to stealth and overall play sneaky cheeki breeki? You can play stealth. - Pretty much unlimited (probably billions) of different mask customization options, if you're into that sort of thing. - There will be a difficulty for you, no matter if you never touched a shooter before or if you have really good aim. Just... Take it easy, please. Here follows a bit of a summary for difficulties: [i]Normal[/i] -> I think you just can't die, cops deal close to no damage whatsoever. [i]Hard[/i] -> Don't be fooled by the name, you really need to want to die and try super hard to fail at this difficulty, cops still deal next to no damage whatsoever. [i]Very Hard[/i] -> For a new player there is a bit of a gap between Hard and Very Hard. You can actually die at this difficulty but it's still super easy. [i]OVERKILL[/i] -> Here's the first huge gap from the previous difficulty, this is where you generally quit messing around too much (unless you have hundreds of hours and you know what you're doing). [i]Mayhem[/i] -> Another huge gap from the previous difficulty, cops deal a lot more damage and will down you in some shots. [i]Death Wish[/i] -> Not too big of a gap from Mayhem, cops do a bit more damage and that's the difficulty I generally play at, where the game is hard but not stupidly hard and down to luck to complete. [i]Death Sentence[/i] -> This is a troll difficulty, stupidly hard where you get downed in 1/2 hits no matter how much armor you are wearing. It's very silly, a lot of times you will rely on spawn RNG to help with level completion. This mode can be really frustrating and restricts the amount of viable builds you can use massively. [i]Death Sentence (One Down)[/i] -> Same as before, but even worse because you can get downed once and the second you go into custody. Hardest mode.  [b]Cons:[/b] - Bugs. Some of which can be fixed with mods, some will be funny. Just have to deal with it, the game isn't perfect like any other game I guess. - Cheaters. I *highly* recommend you to enable the auto-kick feature for cheaters and install some modifications like NGBTO (google it) to further increase your lobby security if you're into hosting, because a cheater is bound to join your lobby sooner or later. - Sporadic crashes. The game will occasionally crash, some mods help with making it crash even more so you have to pay attention to the error logs if that happens.",1566135851,1566135851,1,68,3,0.821906387805939,0,0,0,0,0,

It is an extremely fast paced 4 person co-op shooter, and played at its lower levels of difficulty it can be very thrilling and fun. After you reach a certain point however, PD2 becomes extremely flawed, tedious and irritating. The game has changed so much from its launch days to the end, and the story of the game is also the story of its developer, Overkill Starbreeze. If nothing else, Payday 2 is a bright and shining example of why ""buff things instead of nerfing them"" is extremely toxic to a game's overall longevity.  Like the first Payday game, PD2 cribs very hard from the formula set up by Valve's Left 4 Dead series. You and a group of 3 other friends can team up as bank robbers and pull off daring heists and do random crime related things. The stakes start relatively low with knocking off corner shops and small jewelry stores, and like many other things PD2 related, each new heist scenario had to top the previous one so by the end you're robbing the alien Illuminati and stealing nuclear warheads to sell on the Russian black market.  Part FPS, part RPG, your skills matter just as much as your guns. You'll need to play heists to gain XP to purchase skills, which let you do mundane things like tie down hostages faster or increase your reload speed, to the fantastical such as gain up to 100% more damage the less health you have, or yell at teammates to revive them from a distance. PD2 also features a rather impressive and extensive real world arsenal. Many real life guns and gun attachments can be earned through RNG drops, though the vast loot pool means earning the exact things you want is difficult, and the developers were never able to balance all the guns properly so many are just near-identical copies of each other stat-wise.  Typically heists will start you in a ""casing mode"" where you can wander around and gather your surroundings. For a while, maps had an additional ""pre-planning"" phase that you choose where to place items such as extra ammo or healing kits, as well as purchase assets to make heists easier.  Gameplay has a hard delineation between a stealth phase, and the ""loud"" phase. The stealth is very shallow in depth. You are not able to interact with guards beyond killing them, and you are generally not allowed to kill more than 4 before the game forces the stealth phase to end. A handful of maps have distraction mechanics, but you will mainly be navigating around and avoiding guards. This can be easier said than done due to a lack of situational awareness from being a first person game, along with latency making multiplayer stealth all but impossible even on the best of connections.  The loud phase forms the core of the game. Players must complete heist objectives while managing their resources (mainly health and ammo) and also battle the cops and keep them at bay, lest they be overwhelmed. After years of never ending cycles of ""buff the players -> the players are now too strong -> buff the enemies"", this has evolved from a slow, methodically paced cover shooter into equipping some sort of life steal/fast health regeneration build, combining it with the lowest possible armor for massive speed boosts like you're playing OG Doom with always run turned on, and then bringing either an auto-shotgun or LMG because they are both the highest DPS weapon types in the game and have the most ammo efficiency. It's not even challenging at that point; it's just tedious because the lead designer's idea of ""difficulty"" was having 100 hitscan enemies spawn at once.  There is a lot of DLC in Payday 2, but prospective buyers do not need to be scared off by it. One thing Overkill did before imploding was implement an ""Ultimate Bundle"" option to buy everything at a significant discount, though removing the ability to purchase DLC a la carte was a bad PR move. If you just buy the vanilla edition without DLC, you can still play any of the paid maps as a client; you are just restricted from hosting them. PD2 has microtransactions, but they are fairly benign now and any crates you get can be freely opened.  Now that Overkill Starbreeze is on the verge of shutting down, Payday 3 seems less and less like a reality. PD2 has a ton of bugs that were never fixed, and the balance was left in dire straits. At its height, it spent resources perpetually churning out DLC every month with shiny new overpowered things to keep players paying money instead of fixing bugs and keeping the game healthy. You can chart the fortunes of Overkill Starbreeze by Payday content. They added weird, fourth wall breaking items and content to promote their other games, or fellow indie developers, no matter how poorly it fit with the universe and aesthetic. Someone somewhere is still wearing the Star VR mask, made to promote Overkill Starbreeze's utter failure of a VR initiative. The developers made elaborate map changes to promote their WW2 spin-off, Raid: WW2, another game I also wrote way too many words about. In the final year of content development, before support officially ended and then the development house imploded shortly after, the quality of the content dropped noticeably. Map bugs that hadn't existed in years were back, art and animation quality suffered immensely with a lot of copy-paste implementation, etc.  Don't get me wrong: there's a lot of content in PD2, and experiencing it can be quite fun especially with a group of close friends. If you're into mods, the mod scene is fairly active, though the ease of modding also makes this game a playground for hackers and some of the most popular mods might as well be hacks. The difficulty curve in this game is extremely broken and what depth to PD2's meta that existed before is basically gone, but played casually this game can still be a blast.",1561838094,1561838094,1,430,17,0.952387571334839,32,1,0,0,0,

It‚Äôs a thrill to play with friends, in public matches and campaign mode. I completed the latter, because the contracts are organized in a chronological fashion. It explains the crew‚Äôs backstory, NPCs ‚Ä¶ all wrapped up with a fairly grim ending cutscene (no spoilers). I highly recommend starting the campaign if you‚Äôre more interested in a story-driven gameplay.   Besides that, I enjoy how open-word most of the contracts really are, besides following the mission. All the objectives are clear, direct with variations on how to complete them (Stealth/Loud). Some heists lets you collect more loot than what the objective states for bigger rewards. There are a lot of Easter eggs too, as  packages and trophies that can be found in certain maps. The Steam achievements also challenges players to do more than what is expected.   The Perk decks and skills are also very diverse and mostly balanced. The points used for Perks cannot be undone, but players can adjust their points in skills to their preference, least what is best for the mission(s) being done. This game couldn‚Äôt be complete without the custom mods and skins for weapons and equipment either. So if you aren‚Äôt big on the gameplay itself, you can still enjoy putting colors, patterns and other designs on your character masks, or guns to your liking. Graphics are acceptable, considering this game was released in 2013.     The audio is good, minus the spam of Cop calls during an Assault. Some voice acting could have been improved for Bain and certain characters. The soundtracks were amazing! They can flow from stealth to loud [strike]after you realized your teammate screwed up[/strike]. My favorites are Donacdum and Screech. I also watched some of the video shorts made, and I‚Äôd vouch for a movie or T.V series to be made.   My dislikes however, involves PD2 having no dedicated servers, despite how big its player base is! It‚Äôs still P2P. Because of that, we still encounter lost connection for the Host crashing, or having poor internet. There‚Äôs also a bug for the Mission Summary page, where players and Host are stuck on that screen. This occurs after completing a farming mission that‚Äôs over 30 minutes long like Cook off, and Santa‚Äôs Workshop. Some RNG spawn for cameras and guards are also not kind, for certain heists lol. A lot of the other negative reviews for this game is about the DLC locked content, and it being a cash grab, but it honestly wasn‚Äôt a problem imo. I have like only 2-3 of the DLC and still enjoyed the game regardless.    If you hate DLC cash grabs, then you may not enjoy this game. But if you enjoy skills and equipment modding, customization and enjoy playing as part of a heist gang, then this is the game for you!

The biggest strength of Payday 2 if you ask me was the music, the gunplay and the heisters screaming their heads off every second plus the skill and gun customization that can drastically change how you play the game from heist to heist. The biggest weakness for this game was most definitely the Diesel Engine and how janky stealth is until you spend a decent chunk of time getting used to it and the team not having enough man power to properly balance the game, and Bo most likely telling them to work on new content on their crunch time all day every day.

Let me start by saying I love the heck out of this game. On average, I spend at least 20 hours playing this game every two weeks. Sure, it gets boring after playing it for a while in a single session, but keep coming each and every day and it feels like a brand new experience.  With over 60 damn heists and counting, and with each and every one of them having it's own variants, each time is likely to feel like a brand new experience. There is plenty of variety to behold in this game.  With way over 100 weapons, and each weapon having it's own type, it only adds to the variety. Each weapon has its pros and cons... But for the most part, they're all unique. (Except for a few reskin like weapons.)  Melee... There's not really much to go on here. Each and every one of them feel like a reskin of one another. The best ones are the Kunai Knife and Katana. But if your after a high-concealed build, go for the ice pick. The thing is, they're all locked behind Ultimate Edition. So your best bet is the El Verdugo.  There are a LOT of masks in this game, and I think we're starting to get a little too many. However, most of them have some pretty good customization options and they're all personal preference.  Weapon Skins. If you played games like CS:GO, you'll get this stuff right away. Back in 2015, or so I heard, there were many rants about the Black Market Update. Basically, it added safes. Unlocking them required drills which you had to buy or trade. Esentially, these were Microtransactions. However, in 2016 of Update 100, opening safes became free. As for the skins themselves, they're personal preference just like masks.  There are nearly 20 perk decks, and they can drastically change the way you play. However, a good bit of them require Ultimate Edition with the exception of Sociopath, which requires ownership of Hotline Miami 2 Special Edition.  The skills... There are many skills, and like perks, the way you use skills can change the way you play drastically. The max amount of points you can get is 120. No further than that. Each skill has its own effects, from giving you better deployables to giving you the chance of landing crits to giving you more downs before you go into custody.  The Difficulties. There are 7 difficulties, 7 more if you count the One Down modifier on all of them. Once you get the gist of the game, Hard and Very hard will feel like Normal, OVK and Mayhem feel like chill difficulties, Deathwish is a challenging difficulty... And oh boy Death Sentence. The hardest of them all. Good luck on getting your One Down mask when only 0.4% of all people who played this game have it. (Myself included.)  There are over 1,000 achievements. Good lord, is there ever enough? Actually, I think this is a good thing. With all of these achievements, you'll have something to do. However, once you get them all, your really just playing the game for the sake of playing the game... And that's what games are meant for!  The Community. Before, it was full of people who'd kick others for no reason. But now, most of the community is pretty chill. However, there are a good amount of Cheaters. Don't join them, as they may sound cool giving free EXP and items... That's removing the purpose of a game. Infact, there are even full blown thiefs who use DLC Unlockers, which is stealing from the company who make the game. However, as for outside the game, there are many good Youtubers! From b33croft, who does fun streams on PAYDAY, to Connor Shaw who makes great builds for new players, there are lots of them. It's people like these who keep the game fresh.  Finally, last but not least, the DLC. There are alot of DLC's, however, the future is now!... for a while. Ultimate Edition exists for the new(er) players who have trouble on what DLC's to buy and not buy, so to avoid confusion, it's all packed into a cheap bundle. Not only that, the more DLC you have, the cheaper Ultimate Edition gets! Just remind you, Ultimate Edition and PAYDAY 2 are two seperate things. Ultimate Edition can be bought when you have PAYDAY 2 to get all the DLC in one packaging.  Now, for my overall review.  This game is EXCELLENT! There is plenty of variety to each and every heist, weapon, mask, perk, and skills. The community is an OK place, and the game is constantly getting updated. I suggest picking this game up as soon as you can if other games get too boring for you. There is alot in this game to keep you entertained 'fo' sho''.  This was the Unamused Rex-Rex, and Peace!

It's been that game that you just keep coming back to when you want to kill some time. And cops.  At its core, Payday 2 is a heisting simulator. You and up to three other friends (or bots, if you're so inclined) face off against hordes of AI controlled cops whilst attempting to steal diamonds, money, or what have you from yonder establishment. Or, if you're feeling sneaky, try completing heists in stealth, letting no-one see you.  ---------------------------------  There are many different heists in the game, each with their own tactics and feel. You've got the First World Bank, a large corporation with gargantuan halls and open spaces. There's Harvest and Trustee, a smaller bank with a focus on convenience rather than overwheming... ness. Among others, these well thought out maps provide the perfect playing field for a mash-up of many different player styles (see later). No heist is the same as another, and you will certainly find your favorites among the others. Personally, Big Oil (steal a fusion reactor prototype from a rich inventor's mansion) is my favorite heist.  Each map lets the player move around in a natural way, allowing new players to easily integrate themselves in the game. While a few maps do cause some confusion, there's never really a problem with the map movement, so you'll not be stuck for long. I'd recommend starting off with a few experienced players to help yourself learn the ropes. I've taken the role many times. Don't worry, you're not as bad as you think (Unless you decide to play at the higher difficulties at level 28, then you're just an idiot).  ---------------------------------  Each heist takes on one of two strategies: Loud and Stealth  Loud heists are the most common: You and your friends go in guns blazing, plowing down hordes of cops while attempting to drag your loot through the map to the escape van. You'll learn how valuable headshots are very quickly in this mode. Aside from the standard cop, in this mode you'll see advanced members. They take the form of tazers (self explanatory), shields (again, you should know), cloakers (rush and pin you down), snipers (c'mon), and bulldozers (a guy in a bomb-proof suit, will take a ton of damage (6000) to kill, focus on the face). You'll have a much harder time completing your heists, but at least you don't have to worry about being seen. Oh, and you get kick‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•music.  Stealth heists are less common among new players, but experienced ones (like myself) like to take a slow pace sometimes. Usually, a stealth heist has a potential loud element (oh no you were seen get our yer guns), so watch out. In this mode, you'll learn to keep your head down, duck behind corners and around cover, keeping yourself concealed. By default, you can kill up to 4 guards before the pager guy (whom you must answer every time you kill a guard so as not to arise suspicion) calls the cops. Now, if you're like me, this makes no sense. A guard set off the alarm on his pager even though you sniped him without him seeing you? Try the Silent Assasin mod, changes it to 2 pagers max, but non-alerted (see you) guards do not set off pagers. It's nice.  ---------------------------------  Gunplay in Payday 2 is okay, but could probably use a little work. It feels responsive, yes, but it doesn't feel... Good. It's just a feeling, ya know? Play enough shooters and you'll know what I mean. There are good and bad ones. This isn't terrible, but don't expect something amazing, yeah?  There are a variety of weapons in Payday 2, ranging from standard pistols to a chaingun and a shotgun the size of a pistol (wat). Each one has a very high level of customizability, allowing you to add scopes, lasers, change the magazine and more. However, each customization has drawbacks, like reduced stability or lower concealment (especially important in dodge builds, more on those later).  Complementing the weapons are tools like ECM jammers, medkits (single use), medbags (multi use), ammo, turrets, and a few, more uncommon ones. These allow each player to supply a different item to the team, offering advanced inter-team play. These items change the way the game plays, forcing players who want to be effiecient to work as a team.  ---------------------------------  The Payday 2 skilltree offers many different ways to customize your gameplay. As you level up, you gain experience points. These can be applied in many ways, offering differing playstyles to the user. Each item increases your effectiveness as a speedy bag-man, ammo tank, medical wizard, or other such configuration. This allows players to develop their playstyle as they rank, giving them something to work for.  Because of this, players are given two major playstyles: Armor or Dodge.  HEY NEW PLAYER: USE ARMOR! Seriously, you cannot make an efficient dodge deck (loadout) without passing level 100 and reaching Infamy. It won't work. Anyway, armor decks offer the player a huge amount of protection, at the cost of movement speed. You'll almost constantly take damage in a firefight, but you can take it as your health is very high, and your armor covers a ton of damage.  For stealth and speedy users like myself, dodge is the way to go. A dodge player focuses more on the, well, dodge aspect of avoiding damage, rather than just absorbing it. Players like myself have a high chance for a bullet that would hit us to simply miss. However, because you are not given the health and armor boosts offered to an armor player, you will fall very quickly if hit. I've been known to go down in 3-4 shots on higher difficulties. The speed boost is nice though. Always fun to outrun my armored friends.  ---------------------------------  The visuals and sound in Payday 2 are all well and good, but I have found the HUD quality to be a bit lacking. Don't get me wrong, the original is still very functional, but I would have preffered something a little more informative. Thus, I have, for the past year, been using the ""WolfHUD."" It's a common (among modders, at least) HUD that shows quite a bit more information than the original game offers. Just note that you might be kicked from lobbies disallowing mods (though that has only happened once in 150+ hours).  ---------------------------------  All in all, Payday 2 is a great addition to the FPS player's library. If you're interested in shooty shooty gun gun or a slower, more methodical heist, both playstyles are widely accepted in this game. The playerbase is very expansive, and I have never, even in the wee hours of the morning, been unable to find a game. This game has something for almost any player. Even the weapon customization is mostly optional, as long as you stay on the lower difficulties. Have fun out their heisters!  And for God's sake, don't try to stealth from the beginning of the game. You need a silenced weapon for that!",1536627917,1542911953,1,101,2,0.880971550941467,4,1,0,0,0,

Below are some categories I feel are important to touch on, with a TL;DR after most sections.  [h1]General[/h1] Payday 2 is basically a 4-person (other people are filled with bots if you want to solo) co-op horde shooter. Basically you have objectives for a mission that are told to you via in game ""narrator"" and via tool tips on the screen. You complete these while either avoiding (in stealth) or killing (in loud) cops/guards.  Simply put, if you want a solid 4-person co-op with some stealth action but mostly just shooting hordes of cops, then continue on.   [h1]DLC[/h1]  All of the DLC is wrapped into a single package (with the exception of the h3h3 pack as that was designed to support the h3h3 legal fund and honestly is kind of pointless outside of the new characters/perk deck/ completion-ist mindset). There are tons of fun things in the base game, but if you enjoy it or just have the extra money I STRONGLY encourage you to drop the money for the DLC as well as it adds a ton of new missions, achievements, weapons, and perk decks (some of which are all but required on the hardest difficulty).  [h1]TL;DR DLC:[/h1] Buy it if you know you're going to play the game a bunch/have friends you know you'll play with.    [h1]Stealth[/h1]  If you're looking for a game with stealth aspects and the ability to stealth missions it has that. The heists are fun and when done fully stealthed can be very rewarding. But there are some things to keep in mind. If you want to play with others in stealth than it's usually best to play with people you know as pug games can be incredibly hit or miss. There's also a lot of people whose approach to stealth is basically utilize a game mechanic to keep the guards from calling for help until you get everyone incapacitated effectively removing a need for stealth.   There are also several maps where the game can turn into a bit of the waiting game as you're waiting for guards to path away from an objective which can turn very tedious. I still thoroughly enjoy the stealth heists and play them whenever I can but it's something to bear in mind.   Also it's very important to note that MOST heists CANNOT be stealthed, so if you're looking for more of a stealth style game especially a single player stealth game then THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU!  [h1]TL;DR Stealth:[/h1] IF you ONLY want stealth don't buy it. If you want stealth aspects but also loud fun, continue on.   [h1]Difficulties[/h1]  The game comes with 7 difficulties with a mechanic that can be activated for any of the difficulties to add even more of a challenge. At this point the difficulties scale fairly well with the highest difficulty being near impossible with fully knowing the map, bringing the best setup and the best gear for the mission at hand. Below is a quick overview of the difficulties and what to know before buying this game: [list] [*]Normal - Easiest difficulty and to be frank will probably become trivial quickly if you're used to FPS and get used to the game mechanics quickly [*]Hard - Good step up from normal with some new enemy types. If you've played this style of game before probably start here. [*]Very Hard - Stepping stone with more enemy types and a solid ramp up to overkill difficulty [*]Overkill - Honestly where you'll be spending most of your time once you're familiar and still trying to level. [*]Mayhem - If overkill is getting to easy and you want more experience/money this is solid as well. At this difficulty some build/perk decks (see next section) start to break down and become unviable. [*]Deathwish - this used to be the most difficult before the addition of Death Sentence and is where you become extremely limited on how you can spend skill points and which perk decks you can use.  [*]Death Sentence - You're a pro and want and actual challenge? Yeah, do this. Without the absolute best build and perk deck and optimized weapons it becomes incredibly tedious. You basically lose freedom of choice for customization at this point but there are numerous guides for best choices for everything. [*]One Down Mechanic - Not a true difficulty, but a modifier for any of the above. This makes you (without skills) go into custody after being downed twice instead of the original 4x. This plus Death Sentence difficulty makes for the hardest challenges in the game. [/list]  Unless you're a pro at all FPS games, this will offer you numerous challenges for quite a while with Death Sentence w/ One Down being a very rewarding challenge when you can complete them. If you're new to FPS games or not very good, or even just want to have fun without putting a ton of effort in then there are plenty of difficulties available as well.  [h1]TL;DR Difficulties:[/h1] Fully runs the gamut from beginners can complete any mission to you have to bring the best skills/weapons/perk decks/crew in order to complete.   [h1]Learning Curve[/h1] This game has a VERY steep learning curve past a certain point which can be a pro or a con depending on your view point. With your character you have skills and perk decks. Skill points are gained via a standard experience system and perk decks are unlocked a card at a time in conjunction with the experience earned (you choose which order they're unlocked in though).   Skills are akin to skill trees in most standard RPGs where the perk decks function akin to feats/bonuses to specific play style with each perk deck focused on ONE specific style of play. You can only have one perk deck active at a time.The game does allow for multiple builds that you can easily save and switch between but only one can be active at a time.  There are (with all DLC) 20 perk decks, thousands of possible skill combinations (ranging from useful to why would you pick those together?!?!), 104 primary weapons, 56 secondary weapons, 88 melee weapons, 16 throwables, 9 deployable items, of which you bring 1 each of primary, secondary, melee, and throwables and either one or two (depending on skills chosen) deployables.   Add to that that some heists benefit from certain deployables and weapons more than others, and that some enemies can be more easily dealt with by certain weapons/skills and you have A LOT to learn. There are plenty of guides out there but be forewarned that there are a lot of things to choose from.  [h1]TL;DR Learning Curve:[/h1]If you want to play casually at lower difficulties than you can usually bring what you want skill/perk deck/equipment wise, but the higher difficulty you go the more min-maxing you have to do in order to function as needed to complete the mission.    [h1]Heists[/h1]   67 total heists (with all DLC) with only a few repeats (some heists take place over multiple days with each day being it's own mission, and in a few cases one of the days is also available as a standalone mission that is basically identical). Most of these follow the standard go here, do a thing, survive, go someplace else, grab and move bags, etc. there are some very interesting and fun mechanics in some of the games. The level design for most of the heists is also quite solid and most heists feel different from one another enough that you don't feel like you're just doing the same thing over and over again. That being said if you want constant replayability then you might be out of luck as most heists are the exact same each time played (with a few RNG things such as locations of items to grab.  [h1]TL;DR Heists:[/h1] If you want constantly new things every time it might not be a solid fit for you.  [h1]Others[/h1] [list] [*]So MANY ACHIEVEMENTS! If you want to get 100% you'll have your work cut out for you as some are very tedious but some are super fun!

[/h1]  [b] Pros [/b]  [list]  [*] Very addictive leveling system, 25 'infamy levels' acting as prestiges, 100 levels within those prestiges. Working as basic prestiges, losing your money, skill points and not being able to use your weapons; due to weapons having certain levels to be obtained before you can use them.  [spoiler] Such as the Kunai not being equipable until level 55. [/spoiler]   [*] Many ways of playing and builds to try. [spoiler] There is a catch to this that I will get on to in the [i] 'Cons'. [/i] [/spoiler] Being seperate weapon types, a vast skill tree with unique game mechanics. Inspire aced being a very helpful and interesting perk, along side the skill tree system there is a perk deck system; unlike the skill trees these are not taken away when going infamous. Instead seperate points are given to players for completing heists to complete perk decks. Most perk decks focus on a main purpose, either dodge, armour and health - some focus of weird regen mechanics, some work better than others.  [*] Heists, lotta of them and different ways to play them. Variety and replayability is what keeps this game alive, with constant updates [spoiler] and now with all future DLC (bar the H3H3 character pack) being free UPDATE: Ultimate Edition has now been released [/spoiler] coming to the game until somewhen towards the end of 2018. Even without owning the DLC you can still play the heists if someone is hosting it on crime.net or even easier if your friend owns the dlc; if you're planning to get a group of friends to play this game I highly recommend that at least one of you already has or buys the UE - or a decent amount of DLC. This can really improve your experience adding many more available heists to you and your friends.  [*] It's co-op. Being very different (competitivity wise) it's one of the games I still play, since I don't play League of Legends, Overwatch or Black Ops 3 anymore. If you're needing a break from more intense games yet still want to be invested in a game with friends this isn't a bad shout at all - especially with it being free and all, steam were flocking off copies like mad before anyway, I think I paid around ¬£4 ($5ish).  [*] Banging sountrack [spoiler] even thought I don't have it on much. [/spoiler]  [*] Good variety of free and paid heisters with interesting voices and some great actors such as Togo Igawa and Ron Perlman. Even though Rust's (Ron Perlman) voice lines in game can get pretty boring the connections that Overkill have are great for in game appearances.  [/list]  [b] Cons [/b]  [list] [*] Broken piece of shit [strike] drill. [/strike] The amount of bugs I've witnessed within my 200 hours and counting. Holy fuck. I'm not gonna sit here and list the bugs I've had but there is one bug which really needs to be sorted which just makes the game crash between certain players when they're in the same lobby. I have no idea why this happens and has happened once with someone it hadn't happened with when playing before. However, I doubt this will ever happen to the majority of player.  [*] Annoying learning curve. Within your first 10 hours of Payday 2 watching some sort of video to learn some extra knowledge is really beneficial to you and your teams - please for the sake of everyone, when you're a new player make effort to play on lower difficulties, the game starts to get really difficult. I still primarily Over Kill difficulty, when at level 100 with a full build and friends I can make do and have fun with Death Wishm (just about). Also please learn the difference between 'Doctor Bags' and 'First Aid Kits' people will get very annoyed if you waste their charges.  [*] Now what I was on about in the beginning of this, a lot of content - I mean a lot - of contect is locked behind a pay wall. There is more than enough free content, you can't complain with the game being free now, you have all you need to play the game with many builds. Yet, if you want to try everything or something very specific buying DLC is really the only option. Adding insult to injury, you can't just buy the specific packs you want, you now have to buy the whole UE; this isn't bad for older players that owned DLC before, or bought a lot when the sale was taking place. For new players, well, it's a different matter.  [*] Can become boring playing with randoms since there is a huge player base, making easier to run into very hostile and salty players. [/list]   Overall, a great game to play with friends can be a blast [strike] when it's working [/strike] if you haven't already picked this up, it's free dude c'mon.  UPDATE: Holy shit Overkill actually care about the Payday lore and story, so for all you lore lovers there's actually something more with more substance here now.  re: R.I.P Payday 2 - with the complete flops RAID and The Walking Dead game took, I don't see PD3 ever coming out.

It's an RPG game, camouflaged as an arcade-like FPS game. A fitting genre for its purpose. You begin with $30.000 and a silly pistol. To then wield the heaviest armour, a minigun as you yell ""Yippie ka-yay moddafucker!"" as the money pours down over you. The game's realism is..... non existent. You'll find yourself laughing at the stupid AI or feeling overly hyped for doing something that's impossible in real life.  Weaponry is as basic as it goes, some carbine rifles, Ak's, bullpup, standard issue, etc. With some shotguns (double barrel and magazine for instance) and a couple of SMG's and pistols. But then you dwelve deeper into the game as you find out there's a flamethrower, crossbow, RPG, a grenade launcher that can fit in your pocket. Alot of fun stuff and weaponry.  Furthermore, modifications make the game even more amazing. As you play through the game, you get coins and weapon mods. The coins are used to purchase mods, standard. But a mod can be a simpel as an extended magazine or wider barrel. To turning a pistol into a goddamn sniper rifle (No joke, you can google it: ""Broomstick Pistol""). It allows the player to make the game more fitting to your own playstyle.  The levels, heists, stages, whatever you wanna call it. They are..... okay, most of the time. Some heists are extremely sweet, where you for instance: force russian slaves to bag cocaine in christmas presents, avoid getting murdered by a giant or where you raid a massive bank using a piggy bank the size of a Monster Truck. But some heists do tend to be quite boring a bland from time to time: ""Survive for  3 minutes, move to location x, survive for 5 minutes, do that objective, drill open gate, survive for 2 minutes, escape"". I think the game has enough variety in its heists that you can find the one that fits you the best.  The difficulty though, holy cow. It's both a joke and a curse. The more you play the game, the stronger your character gets (RPG elements), but also your generic game understanding. Where then: Normal-Hard-very hard becomes an actual joke. Overkill is normal difficulty. But then it gets a massive difficulty spike with Mayhem and Deathwish. Difficult and not for the faint of heart (my fav difficulties). Now I haven't mentioned One Down and CrimeSpree yet. These two modes can be unforgiving, where a sniper rifle headshot or a full magazine can still leave a cop standing alive as he downs you in less than 5 shots. It's its own class of difficulty, if you like chaos, panic and madness. You'll love it!  Last positive thing is the way you can customize everything (or almost everything).  You have perk decks (which give you continuous buffs) You have a complex skill tree (Which changes the ways you and your weaponry works) 7 types of body armour (each having small differences, such as movement speed and steadiness. Where again, your personal preference is key) And alot, ALOT of weapons, both primaries as secondaries, and TOO MANY MELEE WEAPONS (still fun though). Some throwables, from flashbangs, molotovs to LOVE FROM RUSSIAN BOOMBOOMBANG.  But now that I have praised payday 2. It's time to demolish it!  It suffers from lag, bugs, glitches and crashes: the game's running on an old-ass engine and it can't handle some situations. For instance: whenever I tab out, I instantly lose connection to the lobby I'm in. The game crashes randomly, and sometimes.... stuff just.... fails to work, due to bugs and glitches. This is the biggest let-down, as it can ruin the fun totally. One moment you can be robbing a bank, as at the last 5 minutes, as you're loading up the van, you crash..... no money..... no exp.... nothing......  DLC (now Ultimate Edition) In my opinion, this game's price tag is ok. You purchase the game for (I don't know) $15.00. Only to get 25% of its content. By purchasing the UE of the game, you get full access, but of course, you need even more money. To make the matter worse. The best and most original weapons are locked behind the UE. Most of the fun heists are so too. And completing Deathwish, One down, or a high CrimeSpree without weapons, mods or perk decks from the UE is downright painful.  After these two main issues there are still MANY OTHER small complaints:  -The melee system sucks -The stealth system is brutal, awkward and feels off (In my opinion) - Tooooo many exploits, allowing people to 'legitimately cheat' - Lack of a good tutorial (I still find people screwing up the standard stuff because they don't know how it works) - Achievements that aren't well..... achievement worthy. Some are good and all: We Are All Professionals In the GO Bank job, complete the heist without the alarm going off and without killing any civilians on the OVERKILL difficulty or above.  But others aren't fun, rely on RNG most of the time and.... well.... they are a chore: I Did Not Have Sexual Relations With That Bulldozer While wearing the ""42nd"" mask, trade 7 civilians. => you need the UE, enough luck to get the mask from a drop chance, then wear it (kinda ugly) and trade 7 civs.... something that isn't quite common.... unless you specifically farm for it.... bringing me to my first point: it's a chore!  And some other smaller quirks aswell   ------------ So, that's Payday 2. I would recommend this game for sure, there's alot to learn about and it's fun to make builds, modify guns to then have some fun with your friends. Completing challenges are often felt with satisfaction. Simply said: Payday 2 is a terrible game.... but it's loadsa fun, can't wait 'till Payday 3 (with an improved engine)",1502921894,1502921894,1,67,7,0.81675523519516,5,0,0,0,0,

I've loved this game since the beginning and i still do. The developers are really good at keeping the game up to date and adding more content (both free and paid). Now is it worth paying the $200 or so for the game and all the dlc? No. No game is worth that much. Luckily the game and dlc go on sale so much it shouldn't be a problem. Also not all the dlc is needed either. Like you can PLAY any heist you want as long as you can find a lobby with it but you wont be able to HOST the heists without the dlc required.

My first point is; The game has TOO MUCH Paid DLC. Say to own the game, and to buy every piece of dlc you can it will cost around; $182.61 USD. ($239.52 AUD) My second point is; The game doesn't recieve many bug fixes or patches, they usually just come around in huge updates. As an example, say there was a bug to walk out of the Harvest and Trustee maps, report it to the devs and the update won't come out until a huge patch with some other things like DLC, Other bug fixes/patches, or just general big updates. 3) No facial animations for characters. Yes I know, the game is from 2013, But it deserves facial animations. It's really boring to say, goto the safe house and talk to someone like Bonnie and watch her have no facial animations. (Tad little edit; Yeah, I know you guys have said that it doesnt need facial animations, but it's just weird to look at vlad in the safe house, without his facial animations.) I've played this game for over 200 hours, do I enjoy it? Yeah. Would I recommend it? Maybe. It depends if you want to spend your life savings on DLC (or Game of the year), Otherwise I'd wait for PAYDAY 3 (Which will hopefully be coming soon.) Thanks for reading my review.  edit: holy over 300 people have read this review thank you for taking the time to actually read this!  Edit 2: Someone said some stuff, so I'll add it. 4) There's massive grinds for achievement masks, guns, slots for weapons, infamy, etc. 5) The game needs more free DLC updates. 6)  The facial animations are just a preference. I understand it would be a bit hard to lip sync and the only time you hear them speak is usually in the middle of a heist, wearing a mask, or at the safe house. 7) The Safe and Drills. Yes, drills were removed in update 100, but some safes still require a drill such as; The Sydney Safe, Community Safe 1 & 2, Houston Hoxton Dallas Wolf and Chains, and some others I don't remember. Edit 3 (I don't remember anymore how many times I've gone to edit this): Free DLC: Yes, OVERKILL and Starbreeze need the money but seriously, Atleast have some more events like Spring break and Hoxtons house warming party. Safes: My mistake, I didn't know that the safes that would've required a drill didn't if obtained after update 100, as I never found any of them. And to all those giving me criticism, thank you. I appreciate it. Edit 4 or 5: Characters aren't that important, while they add the perk decks (that are usually useful) they arent needed. DLC Goes on sale every month or so, And the high price all you need to do is pick and choose. You can join other peoples DLC heists, yes I know. From now on, I'm going to stop editing this. thanks for the criticism    (I know i said i would stop editing my review, but that was a while ago. So i've decided to come back and just edit / add a few things.) The Anti-Cheat engine; Punkbuster. It isn't amazing, while its good to know it exists, it doesn't do too much. The Diesel engine: It isn't amazing with huge maps (Scarface mansion, Heat street, green bridge, etc.) It's better with small maps with lots of clutter. (Ukrainian Job, Jewlery store, etc.) The amount of time it takes for each update to come out, even if its just bug fixes; It's usually two or three weeks for every update/patch. The newest free DLC Is amazing, Overkill did an amazing job. At least in my opinion. That's all, thanks for reading this!~  Sydney, jimmy, jacket and Sangres best characters.",1490401203,1591701678,1,317,29,0.885161638259888,17,0,0,0,0,

Dear Overkill Software,  You don't know me, nor do you care to know me. But you know my money, and you took quite a lot of it without returning anything of reasonable value. I bought your game back when it was in beta testing. You know, when you promised us alpha and beta players we where only playing 1/3rd of the game? And that pre-orders would get all future content for free?  I cringed when you lied about us only playing 1/3rd of the game in beta. All you did was unlock our levels to level past 30. And gave us 1 tiny heist that was identical to the smallest map you had already. Only this one was so quickly done that it literally could be run in just 43 seconds or less.  I moaned when you started releasing DLC heists rather than adding to the free ones you had promised us. I even b*tched when you only gave us pre-order alpha and beta players a single $5 DLC for our investment into the game's future.  But the thing that made me stop playing was not any one thing, It was everything. Your total disregard for your consumers has lead me and all of my friends, of which there where a sizable few, to not touch your game in years. The last heist I did willingly for fun was Shadow Raid for point of fact. Back when it was freshly released not even a week old.  A friend who was new to the game was given a free copy of all of your DLCs and in turn bought me the few i needed to be current. We did the Hoxton break out as it was new, and again, I noticed you where pushing buttons and calling shots that made no sense except to force players to play your game more, and pay you more money.   As it was, i had to do asanine and repetitive things like get 20 zipline head shots with a bolt action sniper that had no scope to get said scope. None of which was fun and only served to force me to play in a way that was both counter productive to the team, and left me without a usable weapon as this was the new meta sniper at the time.  That is only one example of how you'd turned this game into DLC Quest. And what of your lies that pile upon this? We where promised things to do with our off shore money, and even before release we where told the main game had safe house customization.  Nothing ever came in the time I played. Nothing of reason or value. And as to my knowing safe house customization is still not in the game, but I could be wrong. The point of fact here is that both of these things where promised within the first 2 months of release or even -AT- release in the case of safe house customization. But they where blatant lies designed to get our money.  I may well be crucified by your blinded masses of hysterical followers for posting this, but the message will be clear regardless. After spending nearly 100$ in this game, I still don't have all of the DLCs, nor do I want them at the rate you're going.  You're not getting a penny more from me, nor my friends who use to enjoy this game. And that pains me as it was one of the most fun games of recent memory, even competing with Skyrim, and trumping Overwatch for the shear fun.   But if I have to keep paying for your DLCs to stay in current content. If I have to do asinine, borderline moronic, achievements for critical items. If I have to be force fed lie after lie, I do not want to play your game. Nor will I play the next.   When Payday 3 comes out. There had best not be any DLC for the first 6 months. You owe us that much. The first 6 months should be free content as you'd promised us we'd get this time but lied to us about. I and those i played with will not be buying 3 if there is any DLC in the first 6 months.  Money talks. You built a game a bout stealing it, and in the process stole mine. It's time to put your theft where it should be, in the game not in reality.  Yours truly, A very disappointed, and spurned fan.  PS: Even having spent at or arround $120 on this game, and owning over half the DLCs it would still take another $90 to buy all the current DLC I dont own. Buyer beware, they will nickle and dime you to death.  PPS: I'd like to iterate that payed DLC is not a bad thing. It‚Äôs the content and quality Vs price margien i'm upset with, a well as frequency of paid Vs free DLC. The main issue is in fact the lying about what preorders and the like would be getting. Had guns and missions been packed together more frequently resulting in about half as many DLC, I'd likely have bought more DLC and played longer as a genuine truth. Had all Missions been Free and guins been the only DLC, i'd likely have been able to pick and choose what i want, or need in the case of meta weapons, easier. Or had all guns been free and missions been the only payed DLC i'd likely have been less happy with that than any other option but it‚Äôs still preferred to what you‚Äôre doing now.  (Edit/Update: After reviewing my account histroy I have revised the numbers on costs. All financial cost is now factual, and nolonger rough approximations based on memory.)",1478751837,1480384511,0,912,65,0.811894595623016,61,1,0,0,0,

However, in 2016, they've knocked it out of the park consistently. At this point in time, Payday 2 is a solid co-op shooter that I would recommend to any fan of Left 4 Dead or Borderlands.  The premise is simple: you and three other people bring two ridiculously-customizable weapons (stocks, sights, compensators, paint jobs, weapon bodies, and more!) along with some other goodies and commit organized crimes. Missions are diverse, from robbing banks to ambushing convoys of armored cars. The jobs vary by mission, but you usually fight waves of cops until you complete enough objectives to escape. You can also silently complete most missions in stealth, but that can get tedious with repeated failures. When you're not stealing priceless goods and fighting the law, you can purchase and customize masks with in-game money, gamble on free item drops, and pay visits to your safehouse.  It's simple, addicting, and overall a good time, especially with friends and voice chat. For the most part, the game is balanced and accessible. It does have loads and loads of DLC, but they are cheap and usually bundled together these days, so you can get almost every weapon for under 10 dollars on sale. Occasionally, Overkill releases free content to the game in patches, meaning you can still look forward to new additions to the game without using your Steam Wallet.  What else can I say? Overkill has redeemed itself. I would recommend buying Payday 2, though I would hold off until it goes on sale so you can grab a lot of the DLC alongside of it.",1476395784,1482876031,1,130,2,0.860232770442963,0,1,0,0,0,

Payday 2 VR is in Beta now, and to my surprise, it's an incredible offering.  Motion feels natural.  Performance is in line with other VR shooters, such as BAM or H3VR.  They came up with a manual reloading system and balanced comfort options without ruining the balance.  They even incorporated multiplayer with standard Payday 2.  Simply put, this has the potential to be the best VR game on the market... watch out, BAM.  Five years of content, well-executed movement, and refined PvE action make this game a must for both old Payday fans and VR enthusiasts alike.  That said, there is one massive gaping flaw in this game: Locomotion.  The current system works well for those prone to motion sickness, but I don't have any issue with joystick movement.  It's what makes, BAM VR, Pavlov, and H3VR more than just tech demos, but actual games.  The current system is far too cumbersome and limiting for higher difficulties, and the sooner proper joystick/touchpad locomotion is implemented, the better.  Also, the Grip button on the Vive is garbage... don't try and use it as an action button, it's a blister waiting to happen.  ~~~ORIGINAL REVIEW~~~  [h1]TLDR: With 505 Games gone and Overkill redeeming themselves, it's time to put down the pitchfork and see where they take this game.  I'm hopeful for the future.[/h1] -- Payday 2 added microtransactions! [i]Yeah![/i] Overkill said they would never do it! [i]Yeah![/i] We should forgive them since Starbreeze/OVK pulled it out the moment they were allowed to! [i]Yea-- Wait, what the f...[/i] Just hear me out for a moment, will ya?  Payday 2 is a game you all have certainly heard of before, for better or for worse.  Years ago, at launch, it was ""barebones but fun with a lot of potential.""  Later, it was ""a friggin' masterpiece every PC gamer should own.""  Later-er, it was ""a good game but with questionable DLC policies.""  Finally, the later-est, it was ""A &#%^ing disgrace with developers breaking promises that nobody should buy.""  So, let's look at what exactly happened, shall we?  But, first, I'm going to talk about the game.  [b]What you need to know[/b] Payday's a PvE title that features AA tier graphics, dynamic/procedural maps, and a crap ton of progression in a generally solid game.  While not without technical issues, Payday has an abundance of content and a large amount of variety in ways to play, particularly in its skills system.  While some of the lower-tier/earlier heists involve some more low-key heists, like taking on a jewelry store, the game slowly ramps up in favor of its late-20th-century action inspirations, from storming a hi-tech mountain base to making your way across a train in motion.  There's a lot to love about Payday, but plenty of issues creep into the late game.  First of all, Payday can be a MASSIVE time sink.  See my hour count?  That's for an Infamy III, or reaching Lv 100 and starting over twice (you keep your perk decks, mods, weapons, etc. but go back to Lv 0 and climb back up again).  A lot of the fun in this game will come from repeating heists in different ways, which can really make the difference between someone who plays this to death and someone who casually puts in 40 or so hours and calls it quits.  There's technical bugs, an odd engine, less-than-great optimization, and other minor flaws that can detract from the game significantly at times, but in the end, it's still a damn fine use of $20.  [b]Stuff not related to the game[/b]  Now, about that microtransaction nonsense?  Yesterday, Payday 2 celebrated its 100th update.  Starbreeze completely bought out the rights to Payday from 505, a company known for being a bit dodgy at times with its business practices, under the deal that they would receive 33% of the profits from Payday 3 (which was confirmed yesterday, get hyped) but no more than $40M.  So what does this mean?  Well, it means Starbreeze and Overkill can do whatever they want with the game. [h1]THEY STARTED BY REMOVING MICROTRANSACTIONS ALTOGETHER AND MAKING THE BLACK MARKET FREE FOR EVERYONE.[/h1]  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-31-payday-3-confirmed-payday-2-ditches-microtransactions I can't stress how important this is.  NOBODY has done this in the past, EVER.  Payday is the very first example of a step back on microtransactions, and they deserve much more than forgiveness for 505's mistake; they deserve your RESPECT.  From death threats to insults to slander, Almir was beaten-down as the figurehead of a company taking the fall for a publisher's decision.  Did he take it personally?  Who knows?  If he did, I can't blame him, because we learned that fateful day in November that the Payday 'community' certainly had the potential to be completely vile.  Yet, Almir and the rest of Overkill's developers, who have supported the game for four years of free and paid content under 505, have been apologizing to US and have finally given the means to reverse their mistake.  Let me just recount some instances of microtransactions for you:[list][*] Killing Floor 2 has a trading market with microtransactions.  This game [strike]hasn't even left Early Access[/strike][spoiler]this review is outdated AF lol[/spoiler], and is already charging for weapon skins and character items with plenty of ""precious"" skins for <$200 on the market.[*]Rise of the Tomb Raider, a $60 SINGLEPLAYER game, has over $300 in purchaseable content.[*]Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 introduced microtransactions and loot to the CoD series for the first time. [spoiler]EDIT: Apparently AW had them as well, it was just wasn't ported over to PC.[/spoiler][*]Overwatch, while launching at a reduced price of $40, has a loot-box system that offers lootboxes of cosmetics (normally obtained by one per level up) for $2 per 2 boxes or higher.  Starting out as a somewhat fair system, it has progressively grown to be more fund-hungry since launch.[*]Most despicably, Valve themselves have THREE virtual markets; they have what is essentially gambling (but without excluding minors) for Team Fortress 2, CS:GO, and Dota 2.  Team Fortress has no rating on the store page and no age-gate, and Dota 2 is rated T.  No action is taken to stop a minor from wasting even hundreds on ""unboxing"" virtual crates for $2.50 per key.[/list]  While Payday 2 had this gambling system I despise, it wasn't [spoiler]entirely[/spoiler] of the developers' free will [spoiler]SPECULATION[/spoiler], and they have made a completely unprecedented move by pulling them.  In a way, I kind of view Overkill and Starbreeze above many other developers now.  It's really great to see something like this in the day and age where microtransactions are starting to just be tolerated.  As for whether you should buy the game or not?  Well, it's Payday 2.  If you like smashing and grabbing things, like taking down lots of zombies with guns cop uniforms, like the feeling of crap in your pants when you hear a Cloaker flying across the room, and don't mind a bit of grinding as you schedule weekly appointments to smash down a mall's windows, then yes, Payday is a great game.  Friends not included, sadly.  This isn't even mentioning the various overhauls since the incidents above, such as the new Safe House with daily raids, and revamped mod support with auto-update capabilities.

When Payday 2 was finally released, it was a broken, unpolished piece of software, the base content was alarmingly low and some of features announced before its release were nowhere to be found. However, the gunplay was a blast and the addition of skilltrees, mask/weapon customization and the card drop system kept the game interesting despite its lack of levels. At this date, the base game offers an acceptable amount of content for its price but still remain broken and unpolished.  I would actually recommend the game if it wasn't for Overkill's behavior these past years.  Of course there are the sheer amount overpriced DLCs and the microtransactions but that's only the tip of the iceberg.  Back in 2014, Overkill hosted the first community event known as the Crimefest, where the community could be awarded free stuff by joining the community group.  Reaching 3 millions members would unlock a the last reward which was a secret at the time. Unsurprisingly, the community thought that this last secret reward was going to be something awesome, so they started to gather everyone they could in order to reach that 3 Millions member mark. And then Overkill ruined everything when they revealed that the secret reward was the fact that they were going to use those 3 Millions of people to advertise a movie and later on the AlienWare Alpha and their own VR Googles and if you leave the group to avoid that kind of advertisement, you can kiss all the the free content released after the event goodbye. Not to mention some of the rewards unlocked were post-poned and released roughly one year later during the second Crimefest.  A couple of month after that event, Overkill released 2 DLCs on the same day which started the trend of putting 2 DLCs on the storefront instead of regrouping all the extra content they made for Payday 2 into one single DLC in an attempt to squeeze as much money as they can from their playerbase.   Then we got the second community event : The Hypetrain which is a Crimefest where the ""free"" rewards are unlocked with a set amount of hypefuel that can only be obtained by buying DLCs on the store. Two DLCs were introduced : The Overkill Pack and the Completely Overkill pack which were not related in any way as their name would suggest (The first being a simple weapon pack and the later being a 25$ ""support"" with 4 masks and a weapon skin ""crafted with love and care [...] A true Payday collectible""). I suppose Overkill thought it would be hilarious to confuse everyone.  But this wasn't enough for Overkill, all the money they were already making wasn't even close to enough. Fast foward to the Road to Crimefest ; the third community event, Overkill came up with the neat idea of giving the community actual in-game challenges that would unlock the rewards upon completion. Once again, the community worked hard to overcome all the challenges and managed to unlock the final reward. And then Overkill once again ruined everything when they revealed that the final reward was in fact a microtransactions system √† la CS:GO. ""But it is not that bad because CS:GO and TF2 does the same thing and get away with it... Right?"" Well, not really, TF2 is a Free-to-play where that kind of business model is expected while CS:GO may be a pay-to-play game but is updated on a regular basis and all the content added to the game beside weapon skins is free of charge.  Meanwhile Payday 2 is not free-to-play, has those kind of microtransactions, is updated on a regular basis but the content added to the game may be paid DLCs. The microtransactions are there just to, again, squeeze as much money from the playerbase rather than support the developement of the game itself.  I cannot think about this game without having a bitter taste in my mouth, Payday 2 could have been something much greater than a money extracting billboard meme-shooter if it wasn't for Overkill greed.  The game is still great but Overkill is ruining it. Since all the money they are already making through microtransactions and DLC sales will never be enough, they will probably come up with something even more disgusting than the introduction of microtransactions in the future.",1452610270,1452631330,0,430,10,0.857020556926727,19,0,0,0,0,

Please keep in mind that i'm german and english is not my native language.  We've been let down and were lied to quite a lot by Overkill Software for the past few years, since the release of Payday 2.  Some of the bugs which have existed since release and the absolutely horrible netcode with all the desync have never been looked into despite the fact that they were mentioned and complained about quite a lot within the community forums.  Yes, i'm aware of the fact that desync is basically the way the engine handles lag but it's not normal to lag behind for 10 seconds or so while in any regular game you're probably having a ping of 300-400 ms connecting to anyone across the world. Not to mention the issues it will get you into. Things like getting tazed by Tazers which you can't even see on your screen or cloakers running and pouncing through walls / being stuck in the same spot for a while instead of actually moving and chasing the player actively when they are meant to.  Another example would be the Hotline Miami heist which causes framedrops for quite a few players. Almir briefly mentioned that they were going to look into it but nothing ever happened.  Guess what? Same thing with the Infamy 2.0 update which was promised to be more than just cosmetics. It contains nothing but masks and EXP boosts which makes it look like it was rushed after the community complained a lot about the non existent release of Infamy 2.0 on the forums. Almir said they were going to look into it ""once the dust settled"" and we haven't heard anything about it ever since.  The release of DLCs just kept getting worse. We're getting new bugs with every DLC which are partially claimed to be features instead of fixing them like the Molotovs which used to take down the armor of Swat Turrets instantly if you were the host of the game and only then. It has been (ab)used for cross promotion (e.g. John Wick, Hotline Miami, Speedrunners, Humble Bundle, Chivalry Medieval Warfare etc.), becoming more expensive and frequent while having less content which also got worse in terms of quality and balancing with each DLC .  The optimization of the latest DLC map releases have been an issue as well causing many players to have stutters and framedrops even with relatively high end rigs like mine. We also had a DLC called ""The completely Overkill pack"" which was a time limited offer and thought of as a donation: it included 4 masks as well as a secret ingame item which has yet to be released. The Game of the Year edition contains 16 of 27 paid DLCs for Payday 2 right now. Do not get fooled by the fact that they added free DLC releases to the cart.  They used the Payday 2 forums to tease us for 35 days straight with content which does not even belong to the game itself, as it was revealed afterwards. All of the content is tied to another game which was not going to be released for at least another 2 years (Overkills The Walking Dead).  There was a Hype Train event which basically forced us to buy DLCs for fuel to complete all of the goals which turned out to be just another cross promotion. One of the goals was a tournament which was supposed to have a price of $250000. It is still unknown what the tournament is or was, who participated and who actually won these $250000.  Safehouse customization -a feature which has been promised to be included for the release of the game- still hasn't made it into the game 2 years after the release of Payday 2.  For the first Crimefest we were promised a new enemy and FBI Files which took them an entire year to develope. They were released shortly before the second Crimefest was announced. The new enemy is underwhelming even though he comes with interesting and unique mechanics. The FBI Files are basically the same thing that PD2Stats used to be; the website of PD2Stats was shut down thanks to that. I'd like you to take a look at the [url=http://www.pd2stats.com]PD2Stats[/url] site to read the story about all of this yourself now.  The latest addition of Overkill Software at day 1 of the second Crimefest -which is celebrating the fourth birthday of the Payday franchise- are microtransactions. Almir himself as well as David Goldfarb said that there would NEVER be any microtransactions in Payday 2 in the past. Proof: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/24240/discussions/0/810924774517838925/#c810925398555174856]Proof #1[/url] [url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521]Proof #2[/url] [url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303]Proof #3[/url] The community has been working hard for 16 days to finish challenges and unlock content which was promised to be free for everyone during the Crimefest itself. They basically added the exact same system that can be found in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive from the colour of the quality of the weapons to the weapon inspection animation itself. Some of these skins will even change the stats of the weapons. Apparently they are coming together with a pre defined set of weapon mods which can not be changed or replaced. The Safe drops will replace your regular card drops which are supposed to get you weapon mods, masks, materials, colours and patterns. These Safes might even contain skins for DLC weapons you do NOT own. A single drill costs 2,49‚Ç¨ right now which is about half of the cash you would spend on most DLCs if they are not on sale (4,99‚Ç¨) and twice as much as they cost right now with a discount of 75% (1,24‚Ç¨). All of this led most of the veteran players to quit playing or even delete the entire game, as well as forum Mods censoring / deleting entire threads which were written and discussed in a civilized manner just as the mods asked for. They even openly admit that they're actively censoring the forums.  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/8/490123197943804165]Proof[/url]  Personally I don't feel like a game which costs about 20‚Ç¨ and comes with additional DLC worth about 110‚Ç¨ should be using any microtransaction system at all; the DLCs are more than enough as it is. Yes i've bought almost all of the DLCs for the full price including the Completely Overkill Pack except for the last 2 or so.  They disabled the LUA hook which is required to run certain mods at day 1 of the second Crimefest too. Whether or not it's related to some mods crashing the game once it gets updated or the fact that some mods are skins / give us an ability to ""create"" skins like GoonMod is up to you and your conspiracy theories.  My very own mod_override skins for the Black and Skull Dozer are still working however.",1445025827,1445303992,0,193,1,0.835289776325226,9,0,0,0,0,

This is a step in the right direction, but in my opinion there are still a lot of wrongs that need to be righted before I can recommend the game.  Original Review:  My friend, Doctor Insano, said it better than I could...  So here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.  That time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release ""We will not ever have microtransactions."" And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.  Last year, there were a series of ""what's next"" audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.  Last year, we had ""Crimefest,"" where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.  Last year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were ""FBI Files"" (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.  This year, Overkill did a ""Hype Train"" event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get ""hype-fuel"" points. With enough ""hype-fuel,"" rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this ""Mask Pack 2.0."" It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.  And most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.  Overkill, shame on you. I truly do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats.

It's a simple formula that worked really well. The long, objective-rich campaigns had enough variety between them that the game never felt stale. Gunplay was satisfying, enemies were challenging, and the DLC added a new class to screw around with. A few maps and secrets got updated as free updates.  Payday 2 is nothing like the first game.  The sequel is essentially a disgrace to the first game. In lieu of lengthy, interesting campaigns, each assignment has been broken up into a bunch of smaller maps with straightforward objectives. Prepare to see the same areas, again and again. Stealth has been overemphasized across the board--killing yourself to restart is a common occurrence. The difficulty just isn't there compared to the first game, either. The matchmaking is also random gen and a complete mess--gone are the easy lobbies of the first game.  It gets worse! The unlock system is heavily dependent on RNG. Customization is RNG. Everything in this game is RNG except leveling.  The game has had DLC after DLC heaped on it. During a sale, it becomes a reasonable price.. when it's off sale expect to pay $50+ just to unlock a decent amount of content.  The game has blatant product placement. John Wick is shoved in your face as a free character. Why this doesn't get more negative feedback, I'll never know.  The new DLC came free of charge.. with a caveat. Now you can enjoy CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 crates, and pay $2.50 to unlock them. As if the game couldn't become more money-grubbing and obsessed with profit. Did I mention the crates are factored into the RNG loot, meaning if you have no intent to pay to unlock them, you can still lose out by getting them when you don't want them?  Game use to have a modding community, too. Overkill has deliberately broken mods with their latest patch. Maybe they'll fix this, I don't know.  Am I against all DLC? Not at all. Plenty of games make great use of DLC. But herein lies my point. This is not a free-to-play game. This isn't a game in which the DLC is cosmetic. You have to pay for the game. Then the DLC, which encompasses characters, weapons, and campaigns, is also paid for. The game has product placement blatantly inserted into it. It then on top of that wants to insert microtranscations. This game has done everything it can to insert pay wall after pay wall.   For what should be a simple, Left 4 Dead style cooperative game, the amount of grind and pay-for-content in tis game is absolutely absurd.  All in all a disaster, right from the start.

PAYDAY 2 is the next installment after PAYDAY: The Heist.  PAYDAY 2, unlike the previous game, has many improvements, upgrades and changes in the gameplay. You don't just blaze your way around to rob a store or bank, drilling the vault and escape. You need more strategy and planning in PAYDAY 2, which also make stealth approach as an option, and sometimes a primary option for most heist. Doing stealth is not easy, but you get bonuses for doing stealth. Teamwork are more encouraged in PAYDAY 2, especially on stealth approach. As a matter of fact, you will need to work together on stealth heist.  The police in PAYDAY 2 are more vary and some are even powerful, as some of them are technically not police, but FBI task force. In lower difficulties you may only meet the police and SWAT team, but in higher difficulties, FBI are your primary enemies. Dozer, cloaker, tazer, shield, they are making a return in PAYDAY 2.  The upgrade system in PAYDAY 2 has also been changed and improved. Unlike PAYDAY: The Heist, you can choose skill tree and perks you prefer the most in PAYDAY 2 and has to focus on that as you cannot become everything, you have to be something for your crew. If you prefer stealth approach, you need to focus on the right skill tree like ghost, or if you like shooting people around, you could be an enforcer. Each skill tree has unique bonus, weapon skill and special equipment, but you are limited with what you are.  Weapons in PAYDAY 2 are also more customizable, barrel, scope or sight, stock, magazine, laser sight and more. You can customize your weapons to suit your skill tree and perks, or just customize them to be something you prefer. Mask can also now be customized with patterns or colors to make yourself unique among other criminals.  Graphics of PAYDAY 2 is far better than the previous, more detailed and more beautiful. With masks and weapons customization system and detailed models, they look so beautiful, making the gameplay so epic and making your customization even more unique. PAYDAY 2 performances are also good, despite sometimes I tend to crash.  In the latest update, PAYDAY 2 introduced microtransactions system similar to those in CS:GO and Dota 2, despite the promises that there will be never a microtransactions in PAYDAY 2. The weapon skin on PAYDAY 2 have differenced however, as some rare skin includes stats bonuses.  Overall PAYDAY 2 is awesome, I recommend this so much.

It was ok back then but lacked content (very few levels, no end game content) and was buggy (guards could see through walls which ruined stealth for me).  Now I'm getting back to the game and I'm surprised how much it improved. There's a lot more missions, equipment, the Death Wish difficulty for real challenges and a very nice Infamy system too keep you playing after level 100 .  What's better is that the devs keep adding things and have more updates scheduled. That's a very good way to keep the game alive.  I could complain that half of the DLCs cost money, but then again another half is free and at least the cash flow is used too keep improving the game.  The mechanics are solid, both shooting and sneaking feels nice. The graphics are good for today's standards. The voice acting is superb ‚Äì so are the 'miniseries' intros filmed with real actors.  The game still has some bugs, the worst being connection issues, but nothing I can't live with.  The community is pretty ok. I see almost no trolls and griefers. Most pub players don't communicate though, so it's best to play with friends or meet some people on the official forums.  But let me warn you ‚Äì the game is extremely grindy. But then it gives you enough challenges and rewards too keep the grind interested.  All in all Payday 2 is one of the best co-op games on Steam and a very good choice for both fps and stealth game enthusiasts.",1415647999,1415647999,1,170,12,0.883897840976715,4,0,0,0,0,

Being the gamer that he is, he would constantly be leading all the heists and missions while I meekly followed behind trying to help.   The sheer variety and creativity in each individual heist is incredible. From your normal bank heists, to breaking and entering the White House; You will never be bored of this game.   Not only that, but pushing yourself and your friends to the limit is possible with so many difficulties.   There were moments where we were over an hour into the mission already, getting so difficult and tough to move forward, but we persevered (also because we put in so much time already), and always ending with a huge feeling of accomplishment.

After an IRS audit stemming from failure to report their gains from stealing mayan gold underneath the First World Bank, the Payday gang has been reduced to knocking down jewelry stores and running petty protection rackets in the DC/Metro area. However, the Unitesd States has passed a PATRIOT-like act that gives the FBI ability to respond to any crime, including armed robbery, extortion, jaywalking, and speeding. As such, the DC police force is completely willing to send dozens of officers to their death for $25,000. In addition, special ops units have been mobilized to be part of these FBI detachments, including units with titanium-laden riot shields that can take an inumerable amount of shots from the front, armed units with tazers providing incapacitating amounts of electricity, martial arts experts who are also part-time olympic runners who are put into tacticool suits, and a man in an EOD suit borrowed from the army. The FBI has also taken help from the 'Private Security Firm' Gensec, who is given a cut of the national budget, allowing them to field mercenaries in military gear and armor. Thankfully for the Payday gang, the position of 'bank guard' at GenSec does not require a high school degree, and as such pager operators do not realize that somebody completely different is talking on the other side of the line, at least until he's fallen for it four times. Now you must fight the man by stealing jewelry, breaking stuff, and stealing more stuff all across DC, all the while helping the gym bag industry.

The level- and skills system is amazing and excites you to earn more money with heists. It contains a lot of action, they're four classes for every game style, so everyone should find a suitable character for himself. The way how the same map changes every round is nice, so it's not everytime the same thing, the cameras are changing the postion, the bank manager is leaving the bank from another side, it's not easy to learn the map by heart, so it's always challenging.

I sure had fun times playing PAYDAY 2, but negativity outweigh positivity by a large margin. The core gameplay and music are quite good I'll admit that. However I promise that there will be a moment when there's nothing left in this game but annoyance. The graphics were simplistic to begin with but now it's laughable. The gore is non-existent and the way rag-dolls work makes kills unsatisfactory. The game is a time sink and a cash grab. Do you want that nice flashlight attachment? How about you waste a couple hundred hours grinding only to get a pile of masks and stupid patterns? And next thing you know, you're buying badly painted but expensive skins with pre-installed attachments. The difficulty is very inconsistent. You can spend half an hour playing normal when all of a sudden a dozen of special enemies charge and immobilize your whole crew. But it's more likely that you won't play the game that long 'cause it will crash. The way developers update the game and the frequency of those updates is nonsensical. Each update makes even top PC struggle, making it straight unusable for an hour or more which forced me to delete the game and redownload the whole thing every time update occurs. And with 100+ major updates and hundreds of ""hotfixes"" (and most updates turn the game into bug infested mess) it became the most annoying thing I've experienced in videogames. Also they constantly change the stats and perks forcing you to waste hours adjusting your build for no good reason.  The company is run by greedy bullies who attack paying customers if they feel that certain achievement was unlocked too quick. They want you to grind same boring heists all day long for months until you buy all $140+ DLCs and boosted skins to win and even then they'll find the way to screw you over. Joined a lobby with a DW heist that is about to end? Too bad, you're a cheater now. Shame on you, Overkill.",1401527661,1475201098,0,87,1,0.869885861873627,4,1,0,0,0,

Four hardened criminals go on their newest crime spree across Washington DC. From drug trafficking to political framing, to the Payday gang, it's just another payday.  Payday 2 is a co-op first person shooter with RPG and stealth elements. Missions have a heavy focus on a risk to reward design, often providing optional objectives within missions. Teams will frequently have to weigh their ability and the situation to get the best payout available.  Combat takes a chaotic shoot em up feel as police show little intelligence, instead opting to overwhelm players by sheer numbers and firepower. Most teams will have little trouble on normal or hard difficulties, however higher difficulties will pose a challenge even to experienced players. The large range in difficulty allows the game to appeal both to casual and hardcore gamers. Weapon recoil and animations make guns feel unwieldy and hefty, creating a very powerful hit between each shot often missing in many FPS shooters.  As players level up they will gain access to skill points, allowing them to gain new abilities and passive buffs.  Payday 2 also offers players the option of using stealth to complete levels without being detected at all. While this can be enjoyable for some, players who are not skilled in the stealth approach will often find themselves waiting around for the 'all clear' back at the spawn zone. Combat can keep players engaged during timed objectives; stealth leaves you just standing around twiddling your thumbs.  While missions are short (mostly lasting 10-20 minutes average), repetition of levels quickly becomes frequent. Replaying the same mission, objectives will remain the same yet many aspects of the level design can change. Levels have many random factors which will force players to alter their approach to a mission. These random factors can range from an escape door no longer existing to the location of the primary objective. Random elements add a lot of replay value to missions as well as stopping players from acting out the same plan repeatedly.  Strong dependency on working as a team can cause public games to be frustrating at times, however they still remain functional and entertaining. Playing with a group of friends is where Payday 2 shows its strengths: a team works tightly together within the chaotic action. Single player, with or without bots, is poor making its simple AI and repetition more apparent, and should be completely avoided. Downloadable content seems reasonably priced, offering new weapons and levels to play. Those who own DLC missions are able to host them, while friends and other players can join without having to own the same DLC.   The price tag comes just short of most AAA titles and the same could be said about the gameplay. Missing animations and high repetition make Payday fall just short of what we expect from top budget titles. Although Payday 2 plays rough around the edges at times, its solid and heavy hitting shooting mechanics along with its RPG and stealth elements allow it to appeal to anyone interested in the action genre.   Pros: +A role available to all who enjoy the FPS genre +Randomized maps add replay value to missions +Weapons feel powerful and weighty +Dependency on teamwork without feeling too weak alone +Free content updates +DLC does not separate the community +Great soundtrack  Cons: -Stealth can fail because of synchronization issues and bugs -High repetition of missions -Absent animations for actions such as jumping  -Hackers can be prominent in public games -Bugs after updates are common  Like the review?

I thought to myself, ""I'd best remember the location of those planks, because when the heist starts I may need to board up windows with them."" It's a testament to how addtictive this game can be. I later shared the thought with my girlfriend and she called me a loser, but I've spent 300+ hours in Payday 2 and not nearly as much time in her so who cares what she thinks. 5 stars.",1387738843,1387738843,1,1388,132,0.931815266609192,41,1,0,0,0,

The character classes offer different play styles and the skills can be mixed and matched to the players desire. There's no campaign mode or true storyline, missions are layed out and you can play through them however you choose, unlocking more as you level up and build a stronger character. Missions often get replayed several times, especially as you decide what your favorite type of job is but it hasn't become boring in the slightest because every job has played out differently with changes in the difficulty, people you play with and randomized layouts. Don't waste your time on the offline mode, it'd be worthwhile but the part that kills it is the AI won't carry items for you, leaving you to move the mission along if that's the type involved. Other than that they're smart and can handle themselves in a firefight.  Overall, Payday 2 is one of my favorite co-op games. If you like shooters and can suspend the lawful good part of your brain for a bit, and have friends to play with, you can't go wrong with this game.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196351645",1386093939,1388060566,1,664,3,0.823616206645966,9,0,0,0,0,

The 4-men crew and the shadow brain Bain continue to involve in series of heists, each one of them provides us a vary in objectives which is a good tradition since the first. Ranging from stealing cash, gold, jewelry, painting to cooking meth or even ""watch the world burn"", no heist is the same or repeative. Besides, the random element not just made a come back but also got improved, cameras, civilians and now map layout and guards' route are completely different each time you want to rob or steal something. I highly appreciate this mechanic since it gives us the replayability and above all, you need to plan ahead and patience to carry out the mission like a real criminal.  Teamwork is a must, and of course it would be so much fun if you can play with your friends. Thus, headphone and mic are essential. To complete a heist successfully without ringing any alarm, we need TEAMWORK. Everyone has a role, a Mastermind takes care of guard and cam silently, a Ghost get in and get out undetected and shaped charges, drill and saw from a Tech and a Enforcer leave no safe or vault enclosed. Co-op never been so brilliant and professional like this before.  However, failure is still an option and many subjective and objective aspects could screw up the whole thing up. And here we come the other side of Payday, the assault, and again, the 4-classes system shines one more time. Enforcer works like a suppressor tank, Mastermind distracts and Technician finishes anyone comes close. Meanwhile, Ghost grabs anything he could and rushes for the escape car waiting outside. In theory, yeah. Police is not dumb. They throw anything in order to bring you in custody. Initially, only few cops and FBI, but later on, a battalion of SWAT, Taser and Shield storm in from almost everywhere. And did I mention about the f**king Bulldozer? Luckily, with the limited but still sufficient war gears Payday 2 offering, you may escape.  Reviewing Payday 2 without referring about the soundtrack is the huge mistake. All the EDM in game are so exciting, catchy and really impress me. Like an adrenaline pumping, it makes every assault section becomes a battlefield of dub step and bullet.  Nevertheless, Payday 2 still bugs me about the unlock mechanic. Why you have to unlock the damn hologram optic while you have enough money to buy out the whole company who made them? At least gives us the option to buy things we cant seem to get unlocked.  Verdict: 9,5/10. Trust me, the best weekend is the time when you rob the bank with other 3 friends online.",1385788552,1385788552,1,164,2,0.811417400836945,5,0,0,0,0,

Ignore everything below - Update  If you're not the type of gamer that play games in multiplayer, you will not enjoy Payday 2. However when playing with three other people is when the game really shines.  Payday 2 offers heists that can be completed without being spotted. You can tie down people as well as security cops, making them your hostage so they won't set of the alarm as you sneak around inside the building, and get away with your loots. However, if you mess up the stealthy part and the alarm goes off, the gameplay changes. Wave after wave, what feels like an entire army of cops will sacrifice themselves trying to prevent you from escaping with the loot. The cops very often behave like they don't really know what they're doing, and can easily be taken down one by one. But the amount of cops can overwhelm you if they catch you off guard.  Payday 2 have a skill system that is split into four categories, focusing on each their thing. One of them is the Mastermind tree that focuses on making you the 'Healer' of the group, while the Enforce tree makes you a freaking Tank. As you level up (Current level cap is 100), you have far enough points to fill up the tree that fits your playstyle, or combine different skills from every tree to really customize your character. The same goes for weapons. You can have two weapons on you, a main and second one, that can all be very well modified as you like. The same goes for Masks.  The way you receive weapon mods, masks and things to customize your masks, is based on luck. At the end of each heist you complete, you get to choose one of three cards laying next to each other with heads down. The card you choose will decide what sort of item you receive, and it is chosen randomly. I think there should be a better way to obtain weapon mods that isn't based entirely on luck.  Overall I really enjoy Payday 2 and my complains with the game are minimal. I wish it offered more options regarding the stealth part of the game, and I hope the cops will become smarter over time and really fight you back. It is good as it is now however, and I will recommend it!",1385507195,1445370841,1,484,2,0.8550945520401,8,0,0,0,0,
